                'In a hectic year that also saw the launch of the inaugural Schoolwear Awards, the association continued to campaign in the media and online for every child to have a good quality uniform.\n' +
                'It commissioned a poll of teachers and an in-depth study by a respected child psychology team to provide evidence of uniform’s benefits. The survey found…\n' +
                '• A majority of teachers think more children have mental health issues than five years ago with more than half saying cyber bullying is on the rise.\n' +
                '• Most teachers also think kids face increased pressure about fashion and appearance with eight out of ten saying good school uniform could help reduce bullying and prevent victimisation based on a child’s economic background\n' +
                '• Teachers believe it’s important for schools to set ‘boundaries’ and that good school uniform reinforces those boundaries\n' +
                'Meanwhile, research carried out for the association with schoolchildren reinforced teachers’ views that school uniform has significant benefits for wellbeing in young people.\n' +
                'The study by Family Kids and Youth revealed fascinating insights into how uniform helps to reduce children’s anxiety about their appearance and fitting in with their peers, as one Year Nine student told the researchers: “With uniform, you can’t be judged. Without uniform, everyone would be competing about what the style is, what the trend is, what you need to wear. I think there’d be more bullying as well and it would be more stress in the morning.”\n' +
                'Many of the young people interviewed said they would feel under pressure to wear branded clothing to fit in, and to avoid being bullied, if there was no uniform. This could pose problems, not only for those who couldn’t afford expensive brands but also for those who could, as they could be labelled rich kids.\n' +
                'The research backed up the idea that uniform can put children in the right mind-set for school. One Year Seven boy commented: “Imagine sitting in a maths lesson wearing your own clothes. I don’t feel like I’d do much work in the whole day if I didn’t have to wear uniform.”\n' +
                'Dr Barbie Clarke, lead researcher for Family Kids and Youth, said: “School uniform seems to play an important role in establishing identity among young people of this age. It can protect adolescents from being picked on. This creates a greater degree of self-confidence, and ultimately helps with the fundamental adolescent need to be accepted by others.”\n' +
                'At a time when young people are under more pressure than ever to buy into fashion and ‘look right’, we wanted to find out the role that uniform plays in children’s well-being in school. It’s clear that both teachers and young people think uniform helps students to feel they belong. It has a role in reducing bullying and establishing children’s identity within the boundaries set by their school. We think every child deserves that.\n' +

                'When were school uniforms introduced?\n' +
                'One of the earliest forerunners of the modern school uniform was introduced by Christ’s Hospital, founded in 1552 to provide an education to fatherless and destitute children. Pupils there today still wear similar blue coats, breeches and yellow socks.\n' +
                'However, it wasn’t until the 19th century when uniforms were widely adopted by schools. Eton College, for example, introduced its famous Eton suit in around 1820.\n' +

                'Many schools have toughened up their uniform codes in recent decades (Image: Getty)\n' +
                'Roughly a century later - in the 1920s - uniforms started to become compulsory for girls as well. Many school uniforms became less stuffy in the 1970s, with sweaters and polo shirts replacing more formal attire.\n' +
                'In more recent decades, though, a lot of schools have again toughened up their uniform codes.\n' +
                'Why do kids have to wear school uniforms?\n' +
                'There’s a number of reasons why most schools - though there are some that don’t - insist that their pupils wear uniforms.\n' +
                'One reason, they say, is that it helps to create cohesion among pupils and reduces the risk of bullying. If everyone’s wearing the same clothes, the argument goes, they don’t have to worry about other kids making fun of their clothing.\n' +
                'They also point out that uniforms help children concentrate on their education, rather than showing off their expensive branded clothing - which a lot of families can’t afford anyway.\n' +
                'How much do school uniforms cost?\n' +
                'Some parents have expressed concern about the cost of school uniforms, which they say is becoming increasingly expensive.\n' +
                'Figures compiled by the Department for Education in 2015 found that the average cost of school uniforms came to nearly £213 per child per year. But some families report that their uniform costs well exceed this, topping £300 for some schools. \n' +

            text: 'Britain\'s obsession with school uniform reinforces social divisions | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett\n' +
                'It’s September, and with it comes that back-to-school feeling that even as an adult you can never quite shake. I associate it with the delicious plasticky smell that emanates from the insides of pencil cases; cool, crisper mornings that hit you as you rush from the house trailing toast crumbs, and of course, new uniform – if your parents can afford it.\n' +
                'In the midst of a pandemic that has gutted the economy, this year parents are finding it all the more challenging to pay for their children’s school uniforms, the Children’s Society is warning. In March of this year, it found that the average cost of buying uniform for a child over the course of a year is now £340. No wonder some parents take out loans, getting into debt so that their child can conform to the school’s wishes, which often include having a sole supplier agreement with a costly uniform company, leaving them with no other option.\n' +
                'I have always found the justification that uniforms demolish class distinctions between pupils to be disingenuous. More than 70 years ago, my grandmother got into grammar school but didn’t go because her foster “family” (I use inverted commas because their interpretation of that role was far from familial) wouldn’t pay for the uniform. When I’ve written about poverty and education, I have received many letters from older readers who cite costly uniform as one of the educational barriers they faced.\n' +
                'Even now, the prohibitive cost of uniforms at certain schools has forced parents to consider other options for their children. But uniforms prevent bullying, we are told – though for every study claiming this, there is another that concludes that school uniforms have no direct negative effect on behaviour, and some have argued they can even provoke bullying.\n' +
                'I went to a school that was fanatical about compliance with school uniform rules, to a point that felt almost militaristic (we are talking girls being lined up against the wall and having the height of their heels measured with a ruler). The poorest children had school sweatshirts that had been washed so many times that they were badly discoloured. My own cuffs had holes in them; some of the other kids had cuffs that had fallen apart completely. Some parents tried to get away with a polo shirt without an embroidered school logo; they were always slightly the wrong shade.\n' +
                'These children were disciplined. I remember feeling the injustice of this, a child held up in front of other pupils, humiliated for the shabby state of their uniform. As for uniforms somehow being a facilitator of better teaching: so much time was devoted to non-compliance checks that it ate into time that could have been spent learning.\n' +
                'I have disliked uniforms ever since. Other European countries seem to manage perfectly well without them, but in the UK there’s a kneejerk response when you tout their abolition. Ultimately, uniforms are a form of social control and conformity in an education system that already doesn’t focus enough on the individual. Children should be encouraged to express themselves, and if they are exposed to different ways of dressing from an early age they are less likely to tease other children for not being “fashionable”.\n' +
                'At 14, I started buying Vogue and knocking up copies of the clothes, with help from my mum, on the sewing machine. We had very little cash but I used to love non-uniform days, the way all the cliques and subcultures were suddenly made visible, how the child you always thought of as square stalked the corridor in rainbow-coloured socks; the goths with their hoodies, usually banned, professing loyalty to Satan.\n' +
                'There was a bit of benign teasing, yes – I remember one boy saying my outfit looked as though it came from Oxfam, as a lot of my outfits did – but that happened anyway: your rucksack, your shoes, your hair, or your way of speaking were at risk of being picked out. There was always something, uniform or not.\n' +
                'The friends I have who went to the rare British secondary schools that did not have uniforms say that there was very little clothing-motivated bullying. Teachers have said the same. One supply teacher told me that one of the worst schools at which she had taught, behaviour-wise, had some of the smartest uniforms; one of the best schools had a child in attendance whose trainers were taped together.\n' +
                'Uniform policies reinforce gender and racial divisions as well as class ones, as racist hairstyle policies, sexist skirt rules, the sexual fetishisation of girls’ uniforms (a third of girls say they have been sexually harassed while wearing their uniforms), and the discrimination faced by trans pupils all illustrate. The argument that they prepare pupils for the workplace is increasingly redundant. With the decline of workplace dressing having been accelerated by the need to work from home during this pandemic, I have no doubt that a suit will look as outdated in a decade as hats and briefcases do now. But I have little faith in a proper conversation about uniforms taking place, so staunchly are they defended.\n' +
                'Why is it that, as a nation, we are so faithful to the concept where other countries are not? Why are so few alarmed by the need of educators to strip a child of his or her individuality at so young an age? And why do proponents continue to hide behind the falsehood that they help poorer pupils?\n' +
                'A bill to make guidance on the cost of uniforms is making its way through parliament. In Wales, guidance on cost and a need for gender neutrality has already been issued. Nonetheless, many of the nation’s schools still appear to be living in the past.\n' +

                'Studies looking into the impact of school uniforms on mental health have shown, for the most part, that they are indeed beneficial. A study commissioned by the Schoolwear Association involved a number of student focus groups and was conducted with the intention of finding out their perceptions of wearing a uniform.\n' +
                'Feedback from the participants (aged 13-17) found that having a uniform meant they didn’t have to worry about what to wear each day and didn’t worry about being bullied by their peers when it came to the clothes they wear. It was even found that uniforms improve concentration and foster a sense of pride. \n' +
                'On reading these findings, I can understand why. Chances are, if kids were allowed to wear whatever they wanted to school, bullies would have a field day picking out differences in others. School uniforms do a huge amount to protect against this, but I don’t think it totally eliminates bullying based on appearance.\n' +
                'I remember vividly rolling up my skirt and buying the ‘right’ shoes to try and fit in with my peers at school. I still got picked on for both. It seemed that despite us all wearing the same uniform, even the subtlest of differences can be picked up.\n' +
                'For me personally, school uniforms affected my mental health in a negative way. At school, I struggled with anorexia and self-harm, a great deal of which was centred around how I looked and whether or not I fitted in with my peers.\n' +
                'It wasn’t until I went shopping, the summer after GCSEs, to pick out new clothes for college that I realised just how negatively my school uniform affected me. \n' +
                'Picking out my own clothes and being free to express myself, gave me a sense of confidence I didn’t know I had. It signalled a chance for me to reinvent myself, away from the uniform I associated with so much pain. I was given a chance to be unique and explore who I was, out of my uniform. It was freeing for me. \n' +
                'Weighing it up, I can see why school uniforms are considered beneficial for mental health and appreciate that my case may have been an exception to the rule. I do think, however, it’s important that, amongst the statistics and research that often come alongside mental health studies, we consider the nuances and remember that everyone experiences mental health differently. \n' +
                'However your child feels about their school uniform, the most important thing is to keep an open dialogue with your child. Keep talking to them and keep mental health a part of the conversation. Try to remind them that there is more to life than school, and when they leave, a whole new world will open up to them.\n' +

                'Valuing your IP\n' +
                'You should regularly take stock of your IP assets. This is called an ‘IP Audit’ and it will help you in valuing your IP.\n' +
                'When conducting an IP audit, you should:\n' +
                '1. Identify the products and services that are crucial to your business.\n' +
                '2. Identify your IP assets and the legal rights associated with them.\n' +
                '3. Identify what market advantage these rights give you.\n' +
                'After you have done this, you should value your IP assets as you would your physical assets. For example your customer list or database can be a competitive intangible asset you should identify and protect. A secret recipe or a unique service technique might also fall into this category.\n' +
                'As a starting point, try to calculate how much time would be required to develop these assets from scratch or how much a competitor might pay for them. An accountant may be able to help you value these assets and place them in context of your business.\n' +
                'Licensing IP\n' +
                'You might consider licensing your intellectual property, or acquiring the right to license others’ IP, for some of the following reasons:\n' +
                'Sharing risk\n' +
                'Where a licensor provides the right to manufacture and sell products, it receives revenues but does not take the risk of manufacturing, promoting or selling the products. The licensee then has the right to use the IP without the expense of developing the product.\n' +
                'Revenue generation\n' +
                'An IP owner can both commercialise the IP themselves and raise income by licensing the IP to someone else.\n' +
                'Increasing market penetration\n' +
                'IP holders can license another business to trade in territories that the owner cannot cover.\n' +
                'Reducing costs\n' +
                'A business may ‘buy-in’ innovation to reduce its research and development costs.\n' +
                'Saving time\n' +
                'A business may get its products or services to market more quickly by acquiring a licence to use existing IP, instead of re-inventing the wheel (sometimes called an ‘engineering workaround’).\n' +
                'Accessing expertise\n' +
                'By taking a licence, a business may tap into expertise that it does not have in-house.\n' +
                'Competitive advantage\n' +
                'By acquiring a licence to use IP, a business may obtain an advantage over its competitors\n' +
                'Collaboration agreements\n' +
                'Businesses may want to work together to develop new products and services.\n' +
                'Whenever you think about taking or granting a licence of any IP, the first step should be to consider the needs and objectives of your business. The specific terms and conditions on which IP is licensed is then usually negotiated by the licensor and licensee.\n' +
                'Franchising\n' +
                'When a successful business wants to expand, one option is to license IP to franchisees. In addition to the actual product or service, the various forms of IPsuch as trade marks, promotional materials, business and marketing systems, shop fit-outs and confidential information can all be licensed to the franchisee to use.\n' +
                'Franchising (see British Franchise Association) is a way of sharing IP with others to distribute goods or services - the franchisor owns the IP rights and the franchisee pays a fee or regular royalties to use them.\n' +
                'A major benefit of the franchise system is the ability to trade under a well-known trade mark. Usually, the franchisor grants a trade mark licence to the franchisee in return for a percentage of the gross turnover.\n' +
                'One example of a successful franchise is Costa® coffee. They give the franchisee permission to use their brand and a business template to use. This sets out how the premises must look, the service levels and training required. The franchisee then gives Costa® a percentage of their earnings.\n' +
                'IP Health Check also shows what IP your business has so you can see if franchising could work for you.\n' +
                'Trade marks\n' +
                'Many people refer to their trade mark as their brand, although a brand is more than just a company logo. A brand is a ‘promise of an experience’ and offers consumers assurance about the nature of the product or service they will receive. The various IP rights covered in this guide combine to provide legal protection for some of the most important aspects of a brand.\n' +
                'A trade mark is a crucial component of a brand; it distinguishes the goods and services from one trader to another. It can be a word, phrase or logo, and can even be a shape, colour, sound, aspect of packaging or any combination of these. You can use your trade mark as a marketing tool so that customers can more easily recognise your products or services.\n' +

                'They must be renewed every ten years, but can be renewed indefinitely. Registered trade marks can be identified by the ® symbol.\n' +
                'The most effective trade marks are those ‘distinctive’ to the goods and services they protect. This allows consumers to identify your goods or service from your competitors.\n' +
                'Not everything can be registered as a trade mark. Trade marks which can be difficult to register include those which:\n' +
                '• describe the products you sell or the services you offer, for example ‘mature cheese’;\n' +
                '• are not clearly of commercial origin for customers, for example, the phrase ‘Putting Customers First’\n' +
                '• have become customary in your line of trade, for example ‘Four by Four’ or ‘4 x 4’ for vehicles\n' +
                '• include a specially protected emblem, for example, the ‘Red Cross’ or the ‘Olympic Rings’\n' +
                '• are offensive to the public, for example, trade marks which contain taboo words or pornographic images;\n' +
                '• deceive the consumer\n' +
                '• are three dimensional shapes which are typical of the goods you are interested in, for example, the shape of a simple plastic bottle for your drink product\n' +
                'If your trade mark does not fall into any of these categories, there is a good chance that it will be considered acceptable for registration.\n' +
                'If, after being published, your trade mark does not then attract any objections from other trade mark holders, it will be registered.\n' +
                'You should receive a formal report explaining the outcome of the examination within 10 days of applying. If your application is acceptable, it can be registered in as little as 3 months from the date of filing. It can obviously take longer if you have objections which you need to overcome.\n' +

                '• an unregistered design right is automatic but offers significantly less protection\n' +
                'Registered design\n' +
                'Design registration protects the appearance or ‘look’ of a product, providing it is new and has individual character. The design must have a special shape, configuration, pattern or ornamentation to be registered.\n' +
                'Some people confuse patent protection and design protection. Designs protect the visual appearance of a product whereas a patent protects a technical product and how it functions.\n' +
                'Registering your design allows you to gain a marketing edge by preventing others from using it without your permission.\n' +
                'You cannot obtain a registered design right for an idea or concept, it’s a ‘what you see is what you get’ right. So, it’s vitally important that your application contains images of the product or the packaging you wish to protect. This must be identical to those you intend to actually place on the market.\n' +
                'Some products can’t be registered because they don’t fit the criteria to be considered a design. In general terms, these are products shaped in a particular way to achieve a technical function, or solely to fit to something else.\n' +

                'Agreeing temporary relief from COVID-related intellectual property would send a powerful message that richer countries and pharma companies are willing to forgo some profit for the greater good.Credit: Brian Snyder/Reuters/Alamy\n' +
                'The world needs around 11 billion doses of coronavirus vaccine to immunize 70% of the world’s population, assuming two doses per person. As of last month, orders had been confirmed for 8.6 billion doses, a remarkable achievement. But some 6 billion of these will go to high- and upper-middle-income countries. Poorer nations — which account for 80% of the world’s population — so far have access to less than one-third of the available vaccines.\n' +
                'One reason for this imbalance is that wealthier countries have been able to place substantial advance orders with the relatively small group of companies that are making vaccines, most of which are based in richer countries. Unless manufacturing and supply can be distributed more evenly, researchers forecast that it will be at least another two years before a significant proportion of people in the lowest-income countries are vaccinated.\n' +
                'This is why around 100 countries, led by India and South Africa, are asking fellow World Trade Organization members to agree a time-limited lifting of COVID-19-related intellectual-property (IP) rights. The main vaccine suppliers, they argue, should share their knowledge so that more countries can start producing vaccines for their own populations and for the lowest-income nations.\n' +
                'This idea needs to be considered seriously because a temporary IP waiver could have a role in accelerating the end of the pandemic. It would also send a powerful message from richer countries and pharmaceutical companies that they are willing to forgo some profit for the greater good. The campaign for a temporary IP waiver is called the People’s Vaccine and is backed by non-governmental organizations, as well as the United Nations’ HIV/AIDS agency, UNAIDS. Its proponents point out that many companies have already benefited from billions of dollars in public funding, through both research and development and advance purchase agreements. And that once the pandemic is over, IP protections would be restored.\n' +
                'But the pharmaceutical industry, richer nations and some researchers argue that temporary relief from patents won’t necessarily speed up manufacturing or supply. They say it isn’t clear whether the world has any spare manufacturing capacity. Even if patents did not apply, securing all the vaccine components, setting up factories, training people and passing relevant laws — all essential to vaccine delivery — could take more than a year.\n' +
                'An alternative to the lifting of IP, they say, is for companies to increase the licensing of their product designs in exchange for payment. This would allow vaccines to be made by many more companies. In addition, the World Health Organization is setting up a facility for companies to share their vaccine technology, skills and other know-how.\n' +
                'Companies and richer countries also note that they are already backing a vaccine scheme called COVAX, which has secured more than 1 billion doses towards a 2 billion target for 2021 to vaccinate 20% of the most vulnerable groups in countries in need of help. However, it’s not clear whether COVAX will be able to reach its full potential before some of the richer countries that are donating supplies have fully vaccinated their own people.\n' +
                'Richer nations were united in their opposition to the IP waiver until last week, when it emerged that the administration of US President Joe Biden is discussing its merits. One factor that could influence a change in policy is that the US government is named on a patent application for a technology used in vaccines being made by several companies, including Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n' +
                'In 2016, researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, working with colleagues at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, filed a patent for a technology that manipulates the spike protein found in coronaviruses, and which can be used to develop a vaccine antigen. The United States could license this technology — or choose not to enforce the patent — once the patent is granted.\n' +
                'Arguably the strongest argument for a temporary waiver is that patents were never designed for use during global emergencies such as wars or pandemics. A patent rewards inventors by protecting their inventions from unfair competition for a limited time. The key word here is ‘competition’. A pandemic is not a competition between companies, but a race between humanity and a virus. Instead of competing, countries and companies need to do all they can to cooperate to bring the pandemic to an end.\n' +
                'There is a precedent for this, says Graham Dutfield, who studies IP in the life sciences at the University of Leeds, UK. During the Second World War, the US government asked companies and universities to collaborate to scale up penicillin production, which was needed to protect soldiers from infectious diseases. Companies could have argued that this would affect profits, but they understood the necessity of subordinating their interests to the larger goal of saving lives and bringing the war to an end. “For a time the US produced virtually all the penicillin there was,” Dutfield says. “But companies did not sue each other for patent infringement and no one had any desire to hold the world to ransom by charging exorbitant prices.”\n' +
                'The fact that the current US administration is now considering the merits of an IP waiver is important, and other countries should do the same. It might not be the best or the only way to rapidly expand vaccine supply, but it does represent an important principle. There are times when competition helps research and innovation; there are also times when it needs to be set aside for the greater good.\n' +

                'The Covid-19 pandemic is among the gravest global health and economic crises in history. By mid-October 2020, it had taken the lives of more than a million and infected at least another 38 million, leaving many of them severely ill. Its social and economic consequences have been widespread and devastating. There is a growing movement of advocates, including Covid-19 survivors and loved ones of those who died, calling for a “people’s vaccine.”\n' +
                'World over, people are pinning their hopes on potential Covid-19 vaccines. The race to develop Covid-19 vaccines has made headlines nearly every day since the World Health Organization (WHO) first described Covid-19 as a pandemic in March 2020. By mid-October 2020, more than 40 vaccine candidates were in clinical trials, and more than 150 others were in earlier stages. Of the top 10 vaccine candidates in the final phase of clinical trials, companies or research institutes headquartered in China, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States were involved in developing them.\n' +
                'Universal and equitable access to a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine is critical to ending the pandemic, or if no vaccine provides absolute immunity, preventing severe illness and death while protecting livelihoods and allowing battered economies to recover from the consequences of the pandemic.\n' +

                'Read a text description of this video\n' +
                'Governments—especially high-income countries that can afford to do so—are using public money to fund Covid-19 vaccines on an unprecedented scale, with more than US$19 billion pledged by mid-September 2020. In mid-October 2020, the World Bank’s board of directors approved US$12 billion in financing for Covid-19 vaccines, testing, and treatment.\n' +
                'In the high stakes race for a potential vaccine, commitments to meet human rights obligations and transparency have been largely absent. Funding of Covid-19 vaccines with public money has been mired in secrecy. Rich governments that can afford to do so are negotiating opaque bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies or other entities, often reserving future doses of vaccines largely for their exclusive use.\n' +
                'Secret deal-making and hoarding future vaccines in a climate where vaccines are widely projected to be in scarce supply—an approach often described as “vaccine nationalism”—have dealt massive blows to any global vision for universal and equitable access to an affordable vaccine and risks leaving people from low- and middle-income countries to pick through whatever is left after rich countries have served themselves. As Fatima Hassan, a South African human rights lawyer and intellectual property (IP) rights expert said, “How vaccines are distributed will expose the divides by race, class, and economic power.”\n' +
                'Bridging these divides in a way that respects the human rights of all is urgent and central to the world’s collective recovery from the pandemic. Human Rights Watch has carried out research examining the rights implications surrounding Covid-19 vaccine availability and affordability. Between April 23 and October 13, 2020, Human Rights Watch had discussions with more than 15 renowned experts on access to medicines, IP, and human rights; analyzed international human rights law and relevant national legal good practices; and reviewed a vast array of publicly available documents and secondary sources. This included epidemiological data; statements and resolutions by the WHO and the UN; reports or other documents by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), pharmaceutical companies, multi-stakeholder initiatives, and others; media reports; and files from legal proceedings. Human Rights Watch also drew on more than six months of reporting on the pandemic’s impacts on different populations, including health workers.\n' +
                'This report examines key elements of a human rights-based approach to Covid-19 vaccines funding rooted in principles of transparency and accountability. It assesses how a variety of core rights—including but not limited to the rights to life, health, and an adequate standard of living—are being taken into account by governments. Human Rights Watch argues that governments spending public money on Covid-19 vaccines should take all possible measures within their power to ensure the scientific benefits of the research they fund are shared as widely as possible “to prevent the unacceptable prioritization of profit for some over benefit for all” and to maximize vaccine availability and affordability within the shortest possible time. While transparency has many aspects, this report looks closely at why governments should report transparently on their funding agreements, terms, and conditions. The concerns and recommendations Human Rights Watch raises in this report, particularly around barriers related to technology transfer and IP, and pricing, are relevant for other Covid-19 health technologies, including testing and drugs, but this report does not cover those areas.\n' +
                '“Sharing the Vaccine Recipe”\n' +
                'Right now, we are in the position where one corporation that is publicly funded may eventually discover or may eventually come across the vaccine recipe and that one corporation will not be able to supply the world. So it’s clear that there is a moral obligation on that corporation to share that recipe so all vaccine manufacturers in the world, so everyone who can, does start making the vaccine.\n' +
                '—Zain Rizvi, law and policy researcher, Public Citizen, July 24, 2020 \n' +
                'High-income governments are using public money to preorder future vaccine doses in ways that undermine universal and equitable vaccine access. This has been with patent disregard for governments’ human rights obligations to cooperate internationally to share the benefits of scientific research they fund with public money to protect the rights to life, health, and a decent standard of living in a globalized world.\n' +
                'The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the body of experts that monitors implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by its states parties stated in April 2020, “[P]andemics are a crucial example of the need for scientific international cooperation to face transnational threats … [i]f a pandemic develops, sharing the best scientific knowledge and its applications, especially in the medical field, becomes crucial to mitigate the impact of the disease and to expedite the discovery of effective treatments and vaccines…. The Committee reiterates that ultimately, intellectual property is a social product and has a social function and consequently, States parties have a duty to prevent unreasonably high costs for access to essential medicines.”\n' +
                'The funding amounts pledged and doses prebooked are frequently changing with new developments. The shifting environment is further complicated by a near total lack of transparency. Governments do not publicly disclose the terms and conditions of their funding, what they have prebooked and for whom, and which manufacturing facilities will be used to supply their preorders. NGOs, researchers, and journalists are piecing together this data.\n' +
                'For example, Policy Cures Research, an Australia-based global health think tank, estimated that by mid-September 2020, the US, Germany, the UK, Norway, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Canada, China, and Spain were the top nine governments, together with the European Commission, funding vaccine research and development, either directly through bilateral deals or indirectly by funding vaccine public-private partnerships like the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). In September 2020, Oxfam International analyzed available information on deals made for five of the nine vaccine candidates that were in the final phase (“phase 3”) of clinical trials at that time. They estimated that 51 percent of the doses were reserved for high-income countries including Australia, Hong Kong & Macau, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, the UK, the US, and the European Union, even though they represent only 13 percent of the world’s population.\n' +
                'World leaders and experts have been clamoring for global cooperation and sharing of health technologies since the early days of the pandemic. Leading groups and experts on access to medicines who are following the funding and procurement efforts, including the European Public Health Alliance, I-MAK, Knowledge Ecology International, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) (Doctors without Borders), Oxfam, the People’s Vaccine Alliance, Public Citizen, South Centre, and the Third World Network, have repeatedly raised concerns that governments are not acting in ways that will ensure potential future Covid-19 vaccines will be a “global public good” accessible to all.\n' +
                'In May 2020, the Costa Rican government spearheaded a Solidarity Call to Action with the WHO to create the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP)—a common shared pool of rights to technologies, data, and know-how that everyone around the world could use to manufacture any medical products needed to tackle Covid-19, including vaccines. At time of writing, only 40 other governments had endorsed the C-TAP Solidarity Call to Action; most of them from low- or middle-income countries. The vast majority of high-income countries have yet to align with the principles and spirit of C-TAP.\n' +
                'Open and non-exclusive licensing unleashes the potential of scientific research that uses public money to maximize public benefit, preventing any one company from holding or controlling access to the data, know-how, and IP required to manufacture vaccines. Governments should use their regulatory powers to require companies and other entities to share data, know-how, and IP, including through open and non-exclusive licensing, to avert a scenario that could, as Fatima Hassan described it, allow drug companies to “play god” and “decide who gets a vaccine and when.”\n' +
                'This is especially important to expand global vaccine manufacturing capacity wherever possible, including in the long-term. As Third World Network, an NGO, has shown through its “VaxMap,” the expertise to manufacture vaccines is limited and highly skewed toward rich countries. Large parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America do not have any significant manufacturing capacity and will likely depend on imports. Only a handful of countries in these parts of the world have vaccine manufacturing capacity: Argentina, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, and Singapore. \n' +
                'High-income governments have blithely ignored the repeated concerns raised by low- and middle-income countries about the significant barriers presented by IP, disregarding historical experience and lessons, especially from the struggle to overcome IP barriers for generic and affordable treatment for HIV/AIDS. This approach fails to learn lessons from past vaccine efforts and the links between pricing and IP, ignores expert opinions by IP rights lawyers, and disregards the growing risk of lawsuits challenging the IP of companies involved in Covid-19 vaccines. Voluntary corporate commitment to open and non-exclusive licensing has been low, making government use of regulatory tools essential to ensure vaccines are widely available.\n' +
                'In October 2020, India and South Africa proposed that some provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) be waived, to allow all countries globally to collaborate with one another, without running into the morass of laws and restrictions governing IP. If adopted, the proposal could enable the sharing of technology and know-how to expand access to the medical technologies needed to save lives and prevent severe illness during the pandemic. Human Rights Watch called on all other governments to support the proposal of India and South Africa.\n' +
                'The time to move beyond rhetoric around global cooperation is now. As James Love, director of the NGO Knowledge Ecology International, said: “It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that vaccines will be in short supply in the short-term. But why make it worse? Giving companies monopolies over vaccines in the middle of a pandemic is criminal.”\n' +
                'All governments should take concrete steps to endorse the C-TAP Solidarity Call to Action and develop a collective strategy to implement it. Governments should cooperate to urgently map out what vaccine manufacturing capacity exists, what has been booked up and for whom, and develop a plan of action to scale-up manufacturing to maximize the availability, affordability, and distribution of any successful vaccine. They should do so in consultation with low- and middle-income governments as well as experts on access to medicines, vaccines, IP, and human rights. Governments should also use their regulatory powers and funding clout to enable technology transfers and sharing of data, know-how, and other IP through open and non-exclusive licensing.\n' +
                'Making Vaccines Affordable for All\n' +
                'Thus far, some companies, universities, and institutes producing vaccines have given vague assurances of “non-profit” pricing and even provided pricing estimates. The estimates reported vary from as little as US$3 per dose to US$72 per dose. Most potential Covid-19 vaccines are expected to require two doses per person, and unlike some other vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines likely will not be once-in-a-lifetime. They will generate recurring expenses and be particularly financially burdensome for low- and middle-income governments as well as those living in poverty. \n' +
                'Regulating prices to maximize affordability is especially important because in many contexts, vaccines will only be accessible and affordable for communities if they are free at point of care. Worldwide, nine percent of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty, surviving on less than US$1.90 per day. In June 2020, the World Bank projected the pandemic could push between 70 and 100 million people into extreme poverty—living on less than US$1.90 a day—in 2020. The pandemic is also projected to widen the poverty gap between women and men and drive a 9.1 percent increase in poverty among women.\n' +
                'Governments have a human rights obligation to take measures, individually and collectively, to ensure companies, universities, and other entities receiving public money use it in ways that maximize vaccine affordability for the benefit of people globally. To this end, governments should use their powers to ensure vaccines are not sold to the highest bidder to maximize profits. Governments should require transparent pricing and third-party audits that demonstrate the company or university has maximized affordability and minimized debt for low- and middle-income countries.\n' +
                'Global Vaccine Procurement Mechanism: COVAX Facility\n' +
                'There is growing interest from many governments—low-, middle-, and high-income—to purchase vaccines through a global procurement mechanism called the COVAX Facility. The COVAX Facility implemented by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—a public-private partnership—is operating subject to the preorder vaccine deals rich governments have already signed. The facility has yet to publish its contracts with companies and other entities. It has not endorsed C-TAP or taken steps to enable wide-ranging technology transfers or address IP barriers through open, non-exclusive licensing. Gavi estimates each vaccine dose supplied by COVAX will cost about US$10.55 and—for two vaccine doses per person—will total more than US$20 per person. Gavi has yet to require transparent pricing coupled with third-party audits to ensure companies producing vaccines for the COVAX Facility are maximizing affordability of vaccines.\n' +
                'Committing to Transparency\n' +
                'People have a right to know how governments spend public money. They have a right to know what measures governments are taking to protect public health and ensure public money is used for public benefit. But governments have yet to disclose even the key terms and conditions under which they have funded companies, universities, and other entities for Covid-19 vaccines.\n' +
                'Transparency is crucial to hold governments accountable for fulfilling their international human rights obligations both within their own borders and beyond them. As Safura Abdool Karim, a senior researcher and health lawyer from the South African Medical Research Council’s Centre for Health Economics and Decision Science said, “Transparency is so pivotal…. We need to know what bilateral deals have been made, what are the preferential terms, and if there are any equitable access terms in these agreements. …Even the poorest of poor should be able to have access to a vaccine at an affordable price.”\n' +
                'The stakes have never been higher. Universal and equitable vaccine access is needed to save lives, protect health workers, prevent people from experiencing severe illness and potential long-term negative health impacts, ensure children return to school, and enable economies to rebuild and families to make ends meet. The lives and livelihoods of billions of people are on the line.\n' +

                '“Fernanda” (not her real name), a nurse in her late 40s, cared for patients with Covid-19 in a government hospital in the state of Ceará, Brazil until April 2020, before authorities began redirecting patients to an isolation ward at another facility. Soon after, she tested positive for the novel coronavirus. “I have three kids, so I panicked,” she said. “How could I protect people at home? I feared that they would be infected as well.” Her husband and children experienced symptoms consistent with Covid-19 but were not able to get access to testing to confirm infection. “I’m still panicking today,” she told Human Rights Watch two months later, in mid-July 2020. “I have been extremely careful. We get very afraid of dying.” Fernanda feared more than half her co-workers had Covid-19, though not all were confirmed. “We lost colleagues. Others were intubated. It was really scary.” She said she is “praying to have a vaccine soon” as she felt, “we will only be safe with a vaccine.”[1]\n' +
                'More than 7,000 miles from Ceará, on the other side of the world, “Sister Noor” works in a ward exclusively for Covid-19 patients in a government hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. She told Human Rights Watch in May 2020, “We have direct and constant contact with patients all day long, whether we are putting in IV [intravenous] lines, or taking a blood sample, or checking their blood pressure, or giving them medicine.” She lamented the quality of the personal protective equipment (PPE) nurses received, adding, “Our caps will tear as we put them on, but doctors’ PPE gowns and caps are much sturdier.” She felt there was an informal pecking order for good quality PPE and wondered how and when vaccines—when available—would be distributed:\n' +
                'I fear the same thing will happen when the vaccines come—the doctors will get it first and we will be pushed to the back…. I don’t even want to think when the actual poor people in need will get vaccines. It will be hospital admin, doctors, politicians first, and everyone else later, if there’s any left. \n' +
                'More than a million people around the world have lost their lives to Covid-19. At least another 38 million people have been infected, many with severe illness.[3]The total number of confirmed cases worldwide has grown exponentially since March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) first described Covid-19 as a pandemic. At that time there were 118,000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 4,300 deaths.[4] Seven months later, at time of writing, the world had more than 300 times more cases and more than 250 times more deaths, with the number of cases continuing to climb at an alarming rate. Many more cases and deaths have likely gone unreported due to low levels of testing and other factors.[5] Today, nearly every country in the world has reported Covid-19 cases.[6] The numbers alone cannot fully reflect the devastation of the pandemic on people around the world, especially older people and health workers.\n' +
                'Worldwide, millions of health workers like Fernanda and Sister Noor, about 70 percent of them women,[7] are risking their lives caring for Covid-19 patients. Underfunded and overwhelmed health systems, inadequate protective equipment, and little government support have exacerbated the risks they face. In September 2020, Amnesty International, the international human rights NGO, estimated at least 7,000 health workers worldwide had died of Covid-19.[8]Women health workers are more likely, as Sister Noor described, to be working in lower ranking roles, with less ability to demand safer working conditions.[9]\n' +
                'Many health workers spoke to Human Rights Watch about their experiences caring for Covid-19 patients. Adolfo Díaz Ruiz, a general surgeon in Nicaragua, said, “In the hospital where I work, at least 20 percent of the health workers have been infected at some point.”[10] A doctor in Soweto, South Africa said, “We are overstretched and are not sufficiently protected. Our wages are being reduced, but I still must pay for my own personal protective equipment (PPE). If I die, I am gone.”[11] In Venezuela, Bangladesh, Burundi, and Lebanon, health workers described precarious and often nightmarish working conditions and grave fear that they would lose their lives.[12]\n' +

                'At time of writing, the WHO stated that 42 vaccine candidates were in human clinical trials.[19] In early September 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organizations that develops vaccines, reported the clinical trials planned to enroll at least 280,000 participants from at least 470 sites in 34 countries.[20] Many more vaccine candidates are in preclinical phases: the WHO tracked 156 such candidates,[21] while CEPI tracked many more in the exploratory phases.[22] Policy Cures Research, an Australia-based independent global health thinktank, had tracked funding for 203 potential vaccines as of October 1, 2020.[23] \n' +
                'Governments have invested an enormous amount of public money in vaccine research and development, and manufacturing and distribution, but as described in detail below, there is little or no information about the terms and conditions of their funding agreements. \n' +
                'Leading groups and experts on access to medicines who are following the funding and procurement efforts, including the European Public Health Alliance, I-MAK, Knowledge Ecology International, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) (Doctors without Borders), Oxfam, the People’s Vaccine Alliance, Public Citizen, South Centre, and the Third World Network, have repeatedly raised concerns that governments are not acting in ways that will ensure potential future Covid-19 vaccines will be a “global public good” accessible to all.[24]\n' +
                'The United Nations General Assembly in late April 2020 adopted a resolution urging the WHO, member states, and other stakeholders to “ensure fair, transparent, equitable, efficient and timely access to and distribution of” a range of tools to address Covid-19, including future vaccines, “with a view to making them available to all those in need, in particular in developing countries.”[25] In May 2020, 140 world leaders and experts in an open letter advocated that all Covid-19 diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines be treated as “public goods” and called for a “people’s vaccine” that is free of charge for those being vaccinated.[26] They wrote, “Access to vaccines and treatments as global public goods are in the interests of all humanity. We cannot afford for monopolies, crude competition and near-sighted nationalism to stand in the way.”[27]\n' +
                'On May 19, 2020, the World Health Assembly comprising of the WHO member governments, adopted a resolution that calls for “universal, timely and equitable access to, and fair distribution of, all quality, safe, efficacious and affordable essential health technologies and products, including their components and precursors, that are required in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a global priority,” including vaccines.[28] The resolution recognizes “the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order to bring the pandemic to an end, once safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines are available.”[29]\n' +
                'II. Vaccine Development and Funding Landscape\n' +
                'Key Global Developments concerning Vaccine Access\n' +
                'Since the World Health Organization (WHO) first characterized Covid-19 as a global pandemic in March 2020, there have been numerous efforts to encourage and facilitate greater global cooperation among governments and other stakeholders to ensure equitable access to a future Covid-19 vaccine and to fundraise for research, development, manufacturing, and delivery of safe and effective vaccines.\n' +
                'At the global level, there have been two approaches. The first is the WHO Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, or C-TAP, championed by the Costa Rican government, which promotes technology transfer and the global pooling and sharing of intellectual property (IP) and is largely aligned with the aims of the “people’s vaccine.”\n' +
                'The second approach is a vaccine procurement effort led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a “public-private partnership” that works to improve vaccine access.[30]Gavi’s “COVAX Facility,” through the WHO’s Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT Accelerator), had not required technology transfers or the open sharing of IP as conditions for companies receiving funds through the COVAX Facility at time of writing.\n' +
                'Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP)\n' +
                'Following the May 2020 World Health Assembly resolution, the Costa Rican government in partnership with the WHO launched a Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), and issued a Solidarity Call to Action, which had been endorsed by 40 other governments at time of writing.[31] As the WHO says, C-TAP “will compile, in one place, pledges of commitment made under the Solidarity Call to Action to voluntarily share COVID-19 health technology related knowledge, intellectual property and data. The Pool will draw on relevant data from existing mechanisms, such as the Medicines Patent Pool and the UN Technology Bank-hosted Technology Access Partnership.”[32]\n' +
                'The Solidarity Call to Action urges all funders to take action to enable the sharing of knowledge, IP, and data for the Covid-19 response, and ensure all funding agreements help promote affordable and accessible Covid-19 related health products. It calls specifically for “global non-exclusive voluntary licensing, transparency and, when necessary, other commitments to expand access by sharing, for example, other intellectual property rights, know-how and data.”[33]\n' +
                '“ACT Accelerator” and the COVAX Pillar\n' +
                'In late April 2020, the WHO launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT Accelerator), a collaborative platform for governments, major private funders, and scientists, calling on governments and private organizations to fund the “development and equitable distribution” of Covid-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.[34] \n' +
                'Two powerful multi-stakeholder initiatives—Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global alliance working to develop vaccines against infectious diseases—lead the Covid-19 vaccines pillar (“COVAX Pillar”) of the ACT Accelerator, together with the WHO.[35]\n' +
                'Gavi, CEPI, and the WHO identified a total funding need of more than US$18 billion for the development and delivery of up to two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021.[36] Of the two billion doses, the COVAX Pillar plans to procure one billion doses for low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2021.[37] The roles of Gavi and CEPI in vaccine research, development, and procurement are analyzed further below.\n' +
                'WHO Equitable Allocation Framework\n' +
                'The WHO has developed a global, equitable, and fair allocation framework that seeks “to promote equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics that are in short supply” and “guide the process of allocation of COVID-19 products among countries (rather than within countries).”[38] In September 2020, the WHO published a separate document describing a “fair allocation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through Gavi’s COVAX Facility,” following the same principles outlined in the broader draft framework.[39]\n' +
                'Priority Target Groups\n' +
                'In both an August 2020 draft that was circulated to stakeholders and the September 2020 publication on vaccine allocation through the COVAX Facility, the WHO proposed that while the Covid-19 vaccine supply is scarce, countries should “focus initially on reducing mortality and protecting the health system,”[40]by identifying target groups based on current scientific and epidemiological data across diverse settings, and prioritizing within those target groups.\n' +
                'In the absence of any specific safe and effective vaccines, the WHO has proposed that “Tier 1,” or highest priority group for vaccination potentially include front-line health workers, people over age 65, and people with certain underlying conditions.[41] The WHO estimated that roughly 20 percent of a country’s population would cover most of the population comprising these groups.[42]\n' +
                'The WHO states that these three categories of populations have been identified assuming “a broad safety and effectiveness profile” of vaccines,[43] further stating that formal policy guidelines will be developed by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization—a body that advises the WHO—after “specific vaccines become available and are considered in terms of their safety and effectiveness in specific populations.”[44]\n' +
                'Phased Allocation\n' +
                'The WHO calls for all countries opting to participate in the COVAX Facility’s global vaccine procurement system to receive vaccines in two phases.[45] First, “an initial allocation of vaccines based on a proportional allocation scheme,” arguing that vaccinating 20 percent of each country’s population would likely “cover most of those in initially prioritized target groups to help to prevent numerous deaths, reduce the societal and economic consequences, and potentially change the course of the pandemic.”[46] The WHO states that “the fixed percentage allows for flexibility in the use of these doses according to national needs and contexts and according to the recommendations issued by SAGE once vaccines are available.”[47]\n' +
                'The WHO states that the initial vaccine supply will not be sufficient to cover 20 percent of the world’s population, and proposes each country be allocated a batch of vaccines to cover three percent its population, enabling—at a minimum—immunization of front-line health workers.[48] Then, additional batches of vaccines would be allocated proportionally until every country had received sufficient doses to cover 20 percent of its population.\n' +
                'Second, once 20 percent of each country’s population was vaccinated, subsequent allocation would be determined based on an assessment of epidemiological risk and the country’s vulnerability.[49]\n' +
                'Governments Funding Covid-19 Vaccines\n' +
                'Government agencies, especially from high-income countries,[50] are investing enormous amounts of public money in Covid-19 vaccine research and development, manufacture, and distribution. By mid-September 2020, this amounted to at least US$19.2 billion.[51]\n' +
                'Governments are pledging funds in different ways. Some governments, especially high- income countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel, together with the European Union, are directly negotiating and funding bilateral agreements with pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research institutes to develop and manufacture vaccines, reserving future doses of vaccines.[52]Some governments are pledging funds to the “COVAX Facility,” a global vaccine procurement mechanism of the ACT Accelerator.[53] Some high-income countries are doing both, that is, signing bilateral agreements and reserving future doses of vaccines, and pledging to procure vaccines through the COVAX Facility.[54]\n' +
                '\n' +
                'On October 13, 2020, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved a US$12 billion financing plan for low- and middle-income countries to fund Covid-19 vaccines, testing, and treatment.[55]\n' +
                'In addition to governments funding vaccines, many government agencies from a variety of countries have approved clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine candidates in their countries.

                'The Role of Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives CEPI and Gavi\n' +
                'The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, play a critical role in vaccine access. CEPI and Gavi are global partnerships whose governance represents different stakeholders—public and private—including the pharmaceutical industry and corporate foundations. CEPI and Gavi have specific mandates to support low-income countries with vaccine access.[58] They receive funds from governments and other private sources, and in turn fund vaccine developers and manufacturers, respectively.\n' +
                'Gavi and CEPI lead the COVAX Pillar—the development, manufacturing, and distribution of vaccines as part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT Accelerator) initiative, described above. Their roles are delineated: CEPI primarily disburses funds for vaccine research and development and at time of writing, eight vaccine candidates funded by CEPI were in clinical trials.[59] Gavi leads efforts to coordinate manufacturing and procurement through a global vaccine procurement system, the “COVAX Facility.”[60] \n' +
                'Gavi’s “COVAX Facility”: Global Vaccine Procurement \n' +
                'The COVAX Facility’s professed goal is to assist poorer countries that cannot sign bilateral deals to fund and procure vaccines, and to provide “an insurance policy” for high-income countries to pool their risk to avoid gambling on a particular vaccine candidate that may not turn out safe and effective, and reduce the chances of a Covid-19 “resurgence by ensuring that the rest of the world gets access to doses too.”[61]\n' +
                'It creates a procurement mechanism where countries can commit to purchasing a set number of vaccine doses through upfront financial contributions. The COVAX Facility will then use the money to make agreements with vaccine manufacturers, giving them market incentives to scale up production to meet the demand.[62]\n' +
                'In a September 2020 article, Gavi’s CEO explained the facility will work differently for rich and poor governments. Countries with the capacity to self-finance vaccine procurement (“self-financing” countries) will be allowed to request doses sufficient to vaccinate between 10 and 50 percent of their population, depending on the amount they pay.\n' +
                'Gavi has created two options for self-financing countries: a “Committed Purchase Arrangement,” or an “Optional Purchase Arrangement.” In the committed arrangement, self-financing countries agree to procure a specified volume of vaccine doses through the Facility, providing a lower upfront payment of only 15 percent of the total cost per dose, or US$1.60 per dose.\n' +
                'In the optional arrangement, self-financing countries will be required to pay greater upfront costs, but be allowed to “choose to opt out of receiving any [particular] vaccine, without jeopardizing their ability to receive their full share of doses of other candidates, subject to supply becoming available.”[63] According to Gavi, the optional purchase agreements would be more attractive to participating countries that have already reserved sufficient doses of a particular vaccine through bilateral agreements.[64]\n' +
                'A June 2020 report to Gavi’s board stated that where governments have already procured vaccines through bilateral deals, they “would be encouraged (but not required) to donate any doses they may not require to the Facility.”[65]\n' +
                'In addition to the self-financing option, Gavi also launched an Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for COVID-19 Vaccines, a mechanism designed to incentivize vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of vaccines to supply 92 countries that are low-income, lower middle-income, or eligible for assistance from the International Development Association.[66] In late September 2020, Gavi’s board was expected to make additional decisions about “the level and extent of support to the AMC group, including co-financing or cost-sharing, operational support, and technical assistance.”[67] At time of writing, these decisions have yet to be made public.\n' +
                'Gavi states that the COVAX Facility will allocate vaccines to all participating countries at the same rate, proportional to their population, and further, that[68]“no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% of its population until all countries in the financing group [emphasis added] have been offered this amount. The only exception is those countries who have opted to receive fewer than 20%.”[69]\n' +
                'In August 2020, Gavi stated that 80 countries that fell in the “self-financing” category expressed an interest in the COVAX Facility.[70] Taken together with the 92 AMC-eligible countries, the 172 countries represented more than 70 percent of the global population.[71] Gavi urged self-financing countries to make binding commitments to the facility by mid-September 2020 and to make their upfront payments by early October 2020.[72]\n' +
                'As of October 12, 2020, Gavi reported that at several dozen countries and economies had signed “commitment agreements,” and a number of others had expressed “non-binding” interest to participate.[73]\n' +
                'A broad range of civil society groups wrote to Gavi’s board of directors in June 2020 to express concerns about Gavi’s COVAX Facility and COVAX AMC and to urge Gavi to meaningfully involve civil society in its plans around the Facility.[74] In mid-August 2020, Gavi, CEPI, and the WHO issued a call for civil society and community organizations to participate in the Vaccines Pillar of the ACT Accelerator.[75]\n' +
                'The groups also made other recommendations to Gavi’s board of directors:\n' +
                '1. allocate vaccines based on public health criteria for all countries;\n' +
                '2. publish all agreements and contracts made with manufacturers, and demand transparency from pharmaceutical companies around their costs;\n' +
                '3. pay no more than the at-cost price for future doses of Covid-19 vaccines;\n' +
                '4. set clear conditions with transparent criteria for advance funds awarded to pharmaceutical companies, stipulating expectations if pharmaceutical companies do not deliver on vaccine manufacture or delivery;\n' +
                '5. require manufacturers receiving its funds to share IP, technologies, know-how, and data in line with the principles of the WHO’s C-TAP;\n' +
                '6. include non-government purchasers of vaccines in its deals; and\n' +
                '7. be accountable to its partners and meaningfully involve civil society in its plans around the Facility.[76]\n' +
                'On September 29, 2020, the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of activists and organizations, wrote to the members of Gavi’s board seeking urgent changes to the COVAX Facility. The group urged Gavi’s board to endorse the WHO’s C-TAP and “use its huge market power to insist on sharing know-how, technology transfer and licensing intellectual property” to maximize vaccine production. The group also called for full transparency on pricing; a flat, affordable vaccine price for all countries participating in the COVAX Facility; and full civil society participation.[77]\n' +
                'III. Rights-Based Approach to Covid-19 Vaccines\n' +
                'It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that vaccines will be in short supply in the short-term. But why make it worse? Giving companies monopolies over vaccines in the middle of a pandemic is criminal.\n' +
                '—James Love, director, Knowledge Ecology International, New York, July 22, 2020\n' +
                'When deciding which population gets a vaccine first, public health considerations will clash with wealth considerations. How vaccines are distributed will expose the divides by race, class, and economic power…. Many clinical trials like those in South Africa are benefiting from public funding and countries are participating with the hope that they will get preferential access to vaccines… If we rely on the benevolence of the pharmaceutical industry, we’re not guaranteed access.\n' +
                '—Fatima Hassan, South African human rights lawyer and intellectual property rights expert, Cape Town, September 15, 2020\n' +
                'Like other infectious diseases, Covid-19 can spread rapidly across borders. Future vaccines may not provide lasting immunity, potentially leaving countries vulnerable to repeated cycles or waves of infection. The protection of any one country’s population from Covid-19 is highly dependent on and interconnected to the protection of populations in other countries. Protecting human rights in the context of a global pandemic requires the “international assistance and cooperation” that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) calls for.[78] The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors compliance with the ICESCR underscored that “[p]andemics are a crucial example of the need for scientific international cooperation to face transnational threats.”[79] They concluded that “[i]f a pandemic develops, sharing the best scientific knowledge and its applications, especially in the medical field, becomes crucial to mitigate the impact of the disease and to expedite the discovery of effective treatments and vaccines.”[80]\n' +
                'Governments should do all they can to make safe and effective vaccines available to as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. The impact of inequitable distribution, especially where large portions of the world’s population, including vulnerable populations within individual countries, do not have timely access to a safe and effective vaccine when available, should not be underestimated. Universal and equitable vaccine access is needed to save lives, prevent people from experiencing severe illness and potential long-term negative health impacts, ensure children return to school, and enable economies to rebuild and families to make ends meet. The lives and livelihoods of billions of people are on the line.\n' +
                'The funding decisions governments make now will impact if universal and equitable vaccine coverage is achieved in a timely fashion. Governments and international actors including the UN and the World Health Organization (WHO) should act swiftly to ensure no entity has a monopoly over any potential vaccine. They should take all feasible measures toward that end, including ensuring no company, institute, or university can invoke intellectual property (IP) protections to create a monopoly, and any such entity using government or international funds to develop vaccines is required to share their technology and know-how to scale-up vaccine manufacturing as quickly as possible.[81] Governments should ensure global manufacturing capacity is expanded and used to the fullest possible extent to make vaccines. Governments should ensure vaccine doses are not sold to the highest bidder to maximize profits but are considered a public good to be pooled and distributed equitably, taking into account those with the most urgent needs.\n' +
                'Human Rights Watch analyzed international human rights law relevant to vaccine access, outlining crucial elements of a rights-based approach to Covid-19 funding and how rights obligations may be fulfilled by imposing specific conditions on funding to corporations, universities, research institutes, and other entities to maximize vaccine availability and affordability. Governments should take all available measures, including via regulatory provisions and funding terms and conditions, to ensure the benefits of scientific knowledge and its applications to respond to the pandemic are shared, and expand vaccine manufacturing and access. Global cooperation and transparency advance governments’ human rights obligations to take individual and collective steps, while “vaccine nationalism”—with governments racing to sign deals with developers reserving as many future doses of vaccines as possible for their exclusive use—does not.\n' +
                'Making Vaccines Widely Available\n' +
                'The huge need worldwide for a safe and effective vaccine demands preparation for large-scale production when one—or more—is identified. Vaccinating the world’s 7.67 billion people[82] would likely require at least double the number of vaccine doses (most vaccines require two doses per person for vaccination), which the world’s leading vaccine manufacturer predicts will happen only by 2024.[83]\n' +
                'Several barriers to scaling up the manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines could be addressed through government action, including conditions tied to vaccine funding that require technology transfer and the sharing of IP to allow mass manufacturing of successful vaccine candidates.\n' +
                'All governments should cooperate to urgently map out what vaccine manufacturing capacity exists and what has been booked up, and further scale-up manufacturing capacity, to maximize the availability, affordability, and distribution of any successful vaccine or vaccines. Such international cooperation is especially urgent because a vast majority of vaccines that are currently being developed have already been reserved by a handful of high-income countries.\n' +
                'Technology Transfer and Sharing of Intellectual Property\n' +
                'The key to universal access is to produce vaccine doses in vast numbers in multiple places. Pharmaceutical monopolies put up barriers that restrict production and drive up prices, putting profit ahead of public health. In these unprecedented times, pharmaceutical companies should pool their knowledge and governments should make this a condition of public funding. Our best chance of all staying safe is to have Covid-19 vaccines and treatments that are available for all—free from patents and other intellectual property barriers.\n' +
                '—Anna Marriott, health policy adviser, Oxfam, October 9, 2020\n' +
                'No corporation can supply the world … it’s going to take time for manufacturers to learn how to produce an eventual successful vaccine. So we should be working now on clearing the barriers and setting up a cooperative framework so qualified manufacturers everywhere can produce any successful vaccines. Right now, there’s just tremendous deference to the regime of confidentiality, corporate secrecy, proprietary exclusive rights, where one company will contract with another according to their commercial interests and working very hard to keep the technology under their control. I think that is very likely to lead to an extremely limited supply and long delays in getting to anything approaching global scale…. [W]e could cut those delays by years … if we could put ourselves on emergency footing.\n' +

                'Vaccine manufacturing is specialized and know-how is one of the key barriers to expanding production.[84] The WHO says transfer of technology is critical for manufacturing and distributing vaccines rapidly.[85] Technology transfer requires companies, universities, and institutes to share what they consider “proprietary” data and know-how about the vaccine and its manufacturing processes, including IP such as patents and trade secrets.\n' +
                'The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which oversees implementation of the ICESCR, recently reiterated “that ultimately, intellectual property is a social product and has a social function.”[86]The Committee called on states to “make every effort, in their national regulations and in international agreements on IP, to guarantee the social dimensions of IP, in accordance with the international human rights obligations they have undertaken” and warned, “a balance must be reached between intellectual property and the open access and sharing of scientific knowledge and its applications, especially those linked to the realization of other economic, social and cultural rights, such as the rights to health, education and food.”[87]\n' +
                'Governments should prioritize conditioning all funds, whether directly given to corporations, universities, or institutes, to require technology transfer and the open sharing of vaccine-related proprietary information. Without technology transfer and non-exclusive sharing of IP, vaccine manufacturing is likely to be highly limited and skewed toward rich countries. It will also significantly delay delivery of vaccine doses to low- and middle-income countries, further harming their public health and economies. Zain Rizvi, a law and policy researcher at Public Citizen, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), explained: “Technology transfer means sharing the vaccine recipe … so all vaccine manufacturers in the world, so everyone who can, does start making the vaccine.”[88]\n' +
                'Numerous governments have repeatedly raised alarms about vaccine access for low- and middle-income countries, specifically urging technology transfers and open sharing of IP. In May 2020, Costa Rica and other governments endorsed the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool.[89] In late June 2020, the African Union ministers of health and heads of delegation issued a communique highlighting the challenges for vaccine access in Africa. They called on all countries “to ensure that all relevant technologies, intellectual property, data and know how are openly and immediately made available and rapidly scaled-up.”[90] Without such technology transfer and sharing of relevant IP, experts say it will be impossible to build new vaccine manufacturing capacity where it does not exist.\n' +
                'These concerns come against the backdrop of rich governments signing bilateral deals and stockpiling future vaccines, undermining calls for global solidarity and cooperation toward equitable vaccine access. Leading public health groups and experts on access to medicine have repeatedly warned the current approach—shrouded in secrecy, competition, and a race to fund and conclude vaccine deals—has resulted in “vaccine nationalism” rather than cooperation.[91]\n' +
                'Suerie Moon, co-director of the Graduate Institute Geneva’s Global Health Centre, told Politico the scramble by rich countries to prebook vaccine doses “means that there will be very, very little vaccine available for the rest of the world and for countries that either don’t have the money or the production capacity within their own borders to access the vaccine.”[92]\n' +
                'Currently, there is no international effort to systematically map out the vaccine manufacturing capacity that exists and identify what has already been booked through various bilateral and other procurement efforts. NGOs and public health research organizations are piecing together this information with whatever data is published through various sources including government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research institutes.\n' +
                'A September 2020 Oxfam International study revealed that rich countries with 13 percent of the world’s population had already prebooked more than half (51 percent) of the promised doses of several leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates.[93]\n' +
                'Oxfam analyzed available information on deals made around five of the nine vaccine candidates that were in phase 3 clinical trials in September 2020. Oxfam estimated that these five vaccine candidates could yield a total of 5.94 billion vaccine doses for the world—enough to vaccinate roughly 2.97 billion people worldwide, assuming each vaccine requires two doses. But supply deals negotiated with vaccine developers have already reserved nearly 90 percent (5.303 billion) of those doses. The majority (51 percent) are reserved for high-income countries including “the UK, US, Australia, Hong Kong & Macau, Japan, Switzerland and Israel, as well as the European Union,” even though these countries represent only 13 percent of the world’s population. Oxfam explained, “the remaining 2.575 billion doses have been bought by or promised to developing countries including India, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico among others,” and that 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were pledged to the COVAX Facility.[94]\n' +
                'Edward Hammond with the NGO Third World Network explained the harm of governments signing bilateral deals and prebooking vaccines at this early stage: “These [bilateral government] contracts are potentially locking manufacturing into patterns that are harmful to the rest of the world, and developing countries in particular, by locking up production, and by contractually obligating the manufacture of vaccines that might not be very efficient or [potentially] less effective.”[95]\n' +
                'Case Study: Governments Prebooking Vaccines through Bilateral Deals with AstraZeneca[96]\n' +
                'Several rich governments have signed deals with the UK-based biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to prebook millions of future Covid-19 vaccines doses. AstraZeneca is producing the vaccine developed by the UK’s Oxford University.[97] Among the deals that are known to exist (not a comprehensive list):\n' +
                '• The US government gave AstraZeneca US$1.2 billion to develop and manufacture 300 million vaccine doses as early as October 2020.[98] \n' +
                '• The UK government provided at least £85.5 million (approximately US$110.6 million) to Oxford University to develop its vaccine, following a licensing agreement Oxford University signed with AstraZeneca.[99]According to the licensing agreement, AstraZeneca will produce 100 million doses.[100]\n' +
                '• The European “Inclusive Vaccine Alliance,” which includes France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to procure 400 million vaccine doses for €750 million (approximately US$970 million).[101] \n' +
                'These governments have not disclosed specific details of their contracts or agreements.\n' +
                'Where one company has signed agreements with numerous governments or procurement platforms like the COVAX Facility, there is no clarity on the order in which these doses will be disbursed. For example, in May 2020, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, was heavily criticized when its CEO was widely reported as saying the US would be the first to get Sanofi’s vaccine because the US was the first to invest in its vaccine development.[102] A media furor and outrage by the French government led Sanofi to retract its comments.[103] \n' +
                'Low- and middle-income countries with very little domestic manufacturing capacity risk having to wait longer to get vaccine access. They cannot afford to enter into risky advance deals totaling billions of dollars with pharmaceutical manufacturers and therefore stand to lose out on equitable access. Gavi, CEPI, and the WHO set a goal of delivering two billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021, one billion of them for low- and middle-income countries.[104]\n' +
                'The Third World Network has developed an online map, “VaxMap,” that shows the “vastly unequal geographic distribution of manufacturing capacity of Covid19 vaccines.”[105] As VaxMap shows, large parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America do not have any significant manufacturing capacity today and likely will be dependent on imports. Only a handful of countries in those regions of the world have vaccine manufacturing capacity: Argentina, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, and Singapore.[106]\n' +
                'Hammond, an expert on biologics manufacturing, and the creator of VaxMap, told Human Rights Watch that, in his assessment, “[o]utside of India, China, and South Korea … [there is] extremely limited capacity in developing countries. So that [global manufacturing] capacity is hugely geographically imbalanced.”[107]\n' +
                'So far, however, governments have not shown leadership and commitment to global cooperation. In a discussion with James Love and Thiru Balasubramaniam, IP rights experts with the NGO Knowledge Ecology International, Love summarized the problem: “The people funding vaccine R&D [research and development] with public money are doing it in ways that allow [vaccine developers] to monopolize [technological] know-how during a pandemic, a global emergency.” Emphasizing how the pandemic has put certain populations at risk, and decimated the economies of a lot of places, he said that such an approach, “has a massive economic impact in addition to the health impact. And it has human rights consequences.”[108]\n' +
                'Good Practice: Sharing Know-How for Covid-19 Antibody Treatment\n' +
                'In mid-July 2020, Genentech Inc. and other biotechnology companies received permission from the US Department of Defense to share their know-how around manufacture of a potential antibody treatment for Covid-19 currently in late-stage clinical trials. If the treatment is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the companies argued that sharing their know-how could speed up production of the treatment significantly.[109] The agreement is an example of the kind of collaboration public and private actors should take around vaccine development and manufacture.\n' +
                'A legal battle involving Inovio Pharmaceuticals’ vaccine candidate demonstrates how IP rights claims and legal battles can become an impediment to rapid manufacturing.\n' +
                'Mired in Court Cases: Inovio Pharmaceuticals’ Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate[110]\n' +
                'Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an American biopharmaceutical company, is funded by numerous donors, including US government agencies and CEPI, to develop and manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4800.[111]Inovio’s vaccine candidate is being developed using DNA technology. Its goal is to produce one million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020 and further expand production.[112]\n' +
                'But its vaccine development efforts are the subject of a legal battle. In June 2020, Inovio initiated legal proceedings against its manufacturing partner, VGXI (American subsidiary of South Korean GeneOne Life Science Inc) for breach of contract because it wants VGXI to transfer manufacturing technology to other manufacturers to speed up production goals it claims VGXI cannot meet in a timely fashion.[113] Inovio claims: “VGXI has repeatedly told Inovio, orally and in writing, that it cannot manufacture further batches of Inovio’s vaccine at any time in 2020 because it does not have manufacturing capacity to do so.”[114] According to Inovio, VGXI is building a new manufacturing facility that may be available by early 2022, “[b]ut in this environment, that is at least a year or two way [sic], and the world simply cannot wait for VGXI because every minute counts.”[115] Inovio further claims:\n' +
                'VGXI’s breach is causing irreparable harm, and will continue to do so because its failure to transfer the technology is delaying the scale-up, manufacture, and availability of the vaccine, as Inovio and other manufacturers will need to start over and develop an FDA [Federal Drugs Authority]-approved process of manufacturing the vaccine…. If VGXI refuses to permit Transfer Technology, Inovio cannot manufacture the product promptly, safely, or perhaps at all.[116]\n' +
                'Inovio contracted two other manufacturers, German company Richter-Helm and US company Ology Bioservices to scale up manufacturing.[117] Inovio claims both manufacturers are dependent on VGXI transferring manufacturing technology to start production at the earliest.[118]\n' +
                'GeneOne Life Science countersued Inovio and its US manufacturing partner, Ology Bioservices in July 2020.[119] GeneOne claims in its lawsuit: “Inovio got greedy: it saw the opportunity to reap vast riches and keep its stock price soaring” by, GeneOne Life Science claims, “secretly planning for months to take VGXI’s intellectual property and disseminate it to other manufacturers.”[120] The dispute is ongoing. \n' +
                'The Inovio case also shows the disputes that can arise when not all the IP surrounding the actual manufacture of the vaccine is owned by those developing it.\n' +
                'The patent landscape for vaccines is complex. A 2011 study by the WHO, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization (WIPO) states that a “modern vaccine is protected by multiple levels of IP often licensed from multiple partners.”[121]\n' +
                'The multiple layers of IP owned and licensed are significant barriers to scaling up and rapidly manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. Dr. Leena Contarino and Ellie Purnell, IP experts from HGF, a specialist global IP law firm, wrote:\n' +
                'Calls to make all Covid-19 vaccines freely available have been widespread and in some cases companies have already agreed either not to file patents on the novel treatments at all, or to provide royalty free licences to the patents they do file. However, the situation is more complicated than simply allowing or agreeing access to the patent/s protecting the vaccines. In many instances, the new Covid-19 vaccines will be built on proprietary platform technologies, such as viral vectors, mRNA-technology, nanoparticles and the like, which in themselves may be covered by multiple earlier patents owned by multiple different parties. Access to these platform technologies is also required if a novel vaccine incorporating the technology is to be produced and sold.\n' +
                'The number of patents implicated is unknown but likely large. For instance, a 2012 WIPO, WHO, and WTO study tracking patents for vaccines related to infectious diseases found 11,818 families of patents and patent applications (a patent family is a set of patent filings made in various countries to protect a single invention) filed between 1921 and 2011.[123] Most of them were first filed in the US. Other top patent “first filing” destinations included China, the UK, Japan, Russia, the European Patent Office, France, Australia, South Korea, Germany, Denmark, Canada, Spain, Brazil, Sweden, India, Ukraine, Netherlands, and Cuba.[124]\n' +
                'The Need for Contractual Curbs on Exclusive Licensing\n' +
                'Exclusive licensing—when one party grants exclusive rights to another for the use of a specific patent or piece of IP—can be a serious barrier to equitable access and can exacerbate vaccine shortages by limiting the generic scale-up of production. Government contracts for Covid-19 vaccines should use open and non-exclusive licensing, allowing any qualified party to make use of the technology. For example, even though the UK government’s contract with Oxford University to develop a vaccine is yet to be published, it appears the government did not contractually curb Oxford University’s power to negotiate exclusive global licenses. Oxford University then signed an exclusive global license with UK pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, to use its technology to manufacture vaccines.[125]\n' +
                'The exclusive license drew widespread criticism from access to medicines experts. For example, Roxana Bonnell, senior program adviser at the Open Society Foundations’ Public Health Program and access to medicines expert, argued exclusive licensing hinders rapid manufacturing: “Exclusive licensing promotes profits, not public health, leaving a single corporation to decide where a vaccine is available and at what price. With a global pandemic like Covid-19, we need the opposite—global, decentralised manufacturing enabled by non-exclusive licensing, so that vaccines can be produced at the volumes needed.”[126]\n' +
                'Where a company does not voluntarily provide open and non-exclusive license for the use of its IP, it limits others’ ability to manufacture more vaccine doses. Various companies and universities, including Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, HP have voluntarily adopted the “Open COVID Pledge,” pledging to make their “intellectual property available free of charge for use in ending the COVID-19 pandemic and minimizing the impact of the disease.”[127] The pledge is not focused on Covid-19 medical products, including vaccines. While those that have adopted the pledge are predominantly electronic companies, it also includes a few companies that have adopted the pledge in relation to IP for medical products.[128]\n' +
                'Companies taking the pledge issue an Open COVID License, which grants a “non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid-up license (without the right to sublicense) under Pledgor’s patents to make, have made, use, sell, and import any patented invention, solely for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing, containing, and treating COVID-19.”[129]\n' +
                'Companies can choose the standard-format license or publish an alternative license. All standard-format Open COVID Licenses are effective as of December 1, 2019 regardless of when it was first granted. The licenses will last until January 1, 2023 and can be further extended by the pledgor.\n' +
                'While the “Open COVID Pledge” is an important initiative, none of the big pharmaceutical companies, universities, and institutes that are currently involved in Covid-19 vaccine development or manufacture have joined,[130] illustrating the limits of relying on voluntary commitments to open and non-exclusive licensing.\n' +
                'Making Vaccines Affordable\n' +
                'Governments have obligations under international human rights law to respect, protect, and fulfill the rights to life, to health, to an adequate standard of living, and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, among others.[131] For a state party to the ICESCR these obligations are to be met by taking steps “to the maximum of its available resources.”[132] Governments directing money into vaccine development and manufacture from their available resources should therefore be imposing conditions on that funding to ensure corporations and others eventually selling vaccines price them in a way that maximizes affordability and equitable access, and minimizes debt for low- and middle-income countries.\n' +
                'Pricing directly influences how many vaccine doses governments can buy and the extent to which they can make them freely available for populations in their countries. Past vaccine efforts—for example, for human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines to prevent cervical cancer and pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) for children to prevent pneumonia-deaths in low- and middle- income countries—have repeatedly shown that IP rights have a direct bearing on vaccine pricing and in turn, vaccination efforts.[133]\n' +
                'Governments have obligations to ensure health facilities, goods, and services are accessible to everyone without discrimination, and affordable for all. These obligations are owed primarily to those within each government’s jurisdiction, but depending on resources, states also have obligations to help other governments realize those rights in their countries.[134]\n' +
                'Worldwide, nine percent of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty, surviving on less than US$1.90 per day. In April 2020, the World Bank warned, due to the Covid-19 crisis and the drop in oil prices, “For the first time since 1998, poverty rates will go up as the global economy falls into recession and there is a sharp drop in GDP per capita.”[135] The pandemic is also projected to widen the poverty gap between women and men and drive a 9.1 percent increase in poverty among women.[136] In June 2020, the World Bank projected the pandemic could push between 70 and 100 million people into extreme poverty—living on less than US$1.90 a day—in 2020.[137] People living in poverty are more likely to live in crowded or poor-quality housing, and lack the resources to stay at home for long periods or follow hygiene or social distancing recommendations. Low-paid jobs with poor working conditions force them to choose between risking their health or losing their income.[138]\n' +
                'This means in many contexts, vaccines will only be accessible and affordable for communities if they are free at point of care. Governments should attach conditions to their funding agreements to ensure vaccines will be priced to enable governments or international organizations to procure them at an affordable rate that does not jeopardize their ability to meet their other social and economic rights obligations. International cooperation should be directed towards supporting governments to ensure they can distribute vaccines free of cost to populations that cannot afford to pay. \n' +
                'Some recipients of government funding—universities and pharmaceutical companies— have suggested they will adopt pricing strategies that are “not-for-profit” or at minimal profit.[139] The information thus far disclosed is scant or vague. Where a little more information about potential pricing is made available, experts have raised concerns that the cost risks putting vaccines out of the reach of poor countries and people living in poverty. For example, in July 2020, Priti Krishtel, the co-founder of I-MAK, responded to early pricing information that was publicly available at that time: \n' +
                'When we see the first prices that are being announced, the only public prices that we really have to date, are saying about [US]$10-13 per dose. Now if that’s true, that’s more than twice what we are seeing being paid for the most expensive vaccine in the poorest countries.[140]\n' +
                'Pricing information that has become available over time shows prices can vary hugely, and also depend on the underlying technological platform used. Pricing in the case of Covid-19 vaccines is particularly important because these may not be once-in-a-lifetime vaccines, therefore creating recurring expenses that could be a barrier to access for low- and middle-income governments as well as people living in poverty.[141]\n' +
                'The US government in mid-July 2020 signed a US$2 billion deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to reserve 100 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine the company is testing.[142] The government agreed to pay Pfizer’s price of approximately US$20 per dose for the vaccine, which may involve a two-dose regimen costing about US$40 per person.[143] Another news outlet reported that a vaccine being developed by Sinopharm, a Chinese company, would cost about US$144 for two doses.[144] The lowest estimate thus far appears to have been projected by the Serum Institute of India, which announced it would manufacture AstraZeneca/Oxford and Novavax vaccines at a price capped at US$3 per dose for low- and middle-income countries, costing US$6 per person for a two-dose vaccine course.[145]\n' +
                'Gavi claims the COVAX Facility will “use the collective purchasing power that comes from having so many countries participate in order to negotiate highly competitive prices from manufacturers that are then passed on to participants.”[146] In a September 2020 document, Gavi stated the COVAX Facility will try to negotiate prices that are “lower than or at least no higher than pricing manufacturers have agreed in bilateral deals”—which vary widely, as Human Rights Watch explained above. Gavi has made an “estimated all-inclusive price per dose of [US]$10.55.”[147] Gavi has made clear that deals between manufacturers and the facility “will dictate the final price of the vaccine and whether the pricing structure is flat/single or tiered.”[148] At time of writing, Gavi was yet to require transparent pricing and third party audits.\n' +
                'Urgent Need for Governments to Invoke their Regulatory Powers\n' +
                'Governments should use their regulatory powers to maximize the manufacturing capacity for, and the affordability of, Covid-19 related medical products, including vaccines. This includes pricing regulations as well as regulations for compulsory licensing covering all Covid-19 medical products, including vaccines.\n' +
                'Using Compulsory Licenses to Scale up Manufacturing\n' +
                'Under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) governments can issue compulsory licenses, that is, give third parties the right to use a patent without the authorization of the patent holder. “Compulsory license” is used to describe different types of non-voluntary licenses that a government can issue.[149] In some situations, for example, where the government itself seeks to use the patent for “public non-commercial use,” it does not have to seek prior authorization of the patent holder. Similarly, governments can dispense with the need to seek a voluntary license before issuing a compulsory license during emergencies.[150]\n' +
                'The 2001 Doha Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) (the Doha Declaration) reiterated that IP rights should not be an impediment to protecting public health.[151] The Doha Declaration was negotiated in the midst of efforts to expand access to affordable generic medicines to treat HIV/AIDS. At the time, 9,000 people a day were dying of AIDS, largely in countries where antiretroviral drugs were unavailable or unaffordable.[152] It clarified that in case of public health concerns, including during epidemics, governments have the right to issue compulsory licenses, that is, permitting its use for generic manufacture without the permission of IP holders.[153] The WTO lifted limitations on exports of products manufactured under compulsory licenses to least-developed countries and other countries that have insufficient or zero manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector.[154]\n' +
                'Trade and IP rights experts have raised concerns about the legal amendments needed at national levels to give effect to TRIPS flexibilities and overly bureaucratic processes that exist at national levels, rendering the issuance of compulsory licenses complicated and time-consuming. A 2019 study by WIPO found that at least 156 countries and territories allow compulsory licensing under their respective legal frameworks.[155] To varying degrees the domestic procedural requirements for issuing licenses create significant time-consuming barriers.[156] For example, some countries’ laws require those applying for compulsory licenses to demonstrate they have “waited” for a “reasonable period” for a voluntary license after requesting one, and sometimes include waiting periods of 180 to 210 days.[157]  Licenses can also be hindered by challenges brought through judicial review or other litigation.[158]\n' +
                'In July this year, South Africa wrote to the TRIPS Council, a body tasked with administering the treaty, raising concerns about the “legal, technical and institutional challenges in using TRIPS flexibilities,”[159] pointing out that many countries’ patent laws either do not allow for compulsory licenses or involve time-consuming processes.[160] Similar concerns were also echoed by Hu Yuan Qiong, the senior legal and policy adviser for the MSF Access Campaign.[161]\n' +
                'Further, 37 governments—Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the UK, the US and the 27 EU member states—have opted out of importing products manufactured using compulsory licenses under TRIPS.[162] This makes it harder for manufacturers to produce cheaper products through economies of scale, thereby undercutting the economic viability of manufacturers who produce goods under compulsory licenses. A broad range of civil society groups, including Knowledge Ecology International, MSF, and Public Citizen, have called on these governments to reverse their decision to opt out of receiving generic imports.[163]\n' +
                'At time of writing, the Indian and South African governments had submitted a proposal to the TRIPS Council recommending a waiver from some provisions of the TRIPS Agreement “until widespread vaccination is in place globally, and the majority of the world’s population has developed immunity.”[164] If adopted, the proposal could enable technology transfer and widespread sharing of IP to expand access to testing, treatment, and potential vaccines needed to save lives and prevent severe illness during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n' +

                'Good Practices Around Compulsory Licensing\n' +
                'Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, several governments have introduced new compulsory licensing regulations.[165] According to an August 2020 report by Public Citizen, “Germany, France, Canada and Indonesia have adopted new non-voluntary patent licensing policies. Several have taken steps to license patents, with Chile and Ecuador calling for licenses and Israel issuing a license for a candidate COVID-19 treatment.”[166]\n' +
                'In the past, there have been numerous instances where governments issued compulsory licenses, including for government-use, for public health, especially for HIV/AIDS treatment. According to Ellen ’t Hoen, public health expert and founder of Medicines Patent Pool, between 2001 and 2014, at least 35 governments issued about 50 government-use licenses, mostly for specific drugs to treat HIV/AIDS.[167] In 2001, the US government threatened the pharmaceutical company Bayer with a compulsory license on ciprofloxacin (Cipro), which the government was stockpiling after letters containing anthrax spores were sent to media companies and congressional offices.[168] Bayer responded by lowering the cost of the drug significantly.[169]\n' +

                'Transparency is so pivotal…. We need to know what bilateral deals have been made, what are the preferential terms, and if there are any equitable access terms in these agreements.… Even the poorest of poor should be able to have access to a vaccine at an affordable price.\n' +

                'My concern is around the lack of transparency around the main agreements…. We can’t rely on investigative journalists and civil society speaking to people off the record to find out what’s going on, who put what money where and under what terms and conditions… It’s very difficult to actually know what is going on.\n' +

                'Governments funding vaccine research, development, and manufacture should publish contracts they sign with corporations, institutes, universities, and other entities. Transparency about what has been funded and the terms and conditions are critical for not just government accountability but also holding recipients to account. To date, governments have made very little information publicly available around their funding agreements. Governments should commit to transparency by publishing contracts and reporting in detail on terms, conditions, and other aspects of funding for Covid-19 vaccines.\n' +
                'Governments should also collaborate and publish all information they have about recipients’ pre-existing patents and licenses that are relevant to vaccine development and manufacture. This will help cut through the time needed for all parties to procure voluntary and compulsory licenses.\n' +
                'Transparency around contracts can also expose lax government oversight and contractual “deregulation.” Currently, there is little or no public information about whether governments funding vaccines have included “march-in” rights, that is, the right to override any exclusive licensing arrangements. The little information trickling out through freedom of information applications in the US shows a dismal trend. For example, analysis by Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a nongovernmental organization with expertise on IP, showed that the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) had effectively watered down their statutory regulatory oversight. KEI received heavily redacted copies of seven agreements BARDA and DoD had signed with companies for Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests they filed.[170]\n' +
                'KEI’s analysis of these agreements found the government had contractually limited or eliminated the government’s rights in inventions and data that was publicly funded. It also found the contracts had renegotiated terms, watering down statutory definitions, and had effectively undercut the powers of US government agencies under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (legislation governing executive acquisitions) and the US Bayh-Dole Act (legislation governing IP rights to federally funded inventions). The Bayh-Dole Act establishes mechanisms for US government agencies to assert certain claims over inventions that are funded by the federal government. This includes “march-in” rights as well as rights of the government to intervene if the invention’s practical application was not made available on “reasonable terms.” KEI found BARDA and DoD had signed contracts with five companies that had “limited its ability to intervene if the pharmaceutical companies (which are party to the agreements and are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars to conduct the research) charge unreasonable prices for the resulting COVID-19 vaccines or treatments.”[171]\n' +
                'V. International Legal Framework\n' +
                'Governments’ international human rights obligations include obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill the rights to life, to health, to an adequate standard of living, and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress.[172] In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the vaccine nationalism and hoarding described above create barriers for many governments seeking to fulfil their human rights obligations, particularly regarding the right to health. Instead, governments should place not only the rights to life and health at the center of their response, but their obligations concerning international cooperation and extraterritorial impacts.\n' +
                'States’ Extraterritorial and International Cooperation Obligations, in the Context of the Right to Health\n' +
                'The obligation of international cooperation has multiple sources. The UN Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has repeatedly emphasized that states parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)—of which there are 171—should recognize the essential role of international cooperation and comply with their commitment to take joint and separate action to achieve the full realization of economic and social rights.[173] The duty for UN members “to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the Organization” to achieve “universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion,” set out in articles 55 and 56 of the UN Charter, is expressed without any territorial limitation and is to be taken into account when addressing the scope of states’ obligations under human rights treaties.[174]Article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) also sets out that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms in the UDHR can be fully realized, setting an expectation for states to contribute to creating an enabling international environment for the fulfilment of economic and social rights everywhere.[175]In particular, article 2(1) of the ICESCR creates an obligation on states to take collective action, including through international cooperation, to help fulfil the economic, social, and cultural rights of persons outside of their national territories.[176]\n' +
                'International cooperation requires states to refrain from actions that interfere, directly or indirectly, with the enjoyment of rights in other countries; no state should act in ways that frustrate the efforts of other states to comply with their human rights obligations, including when negotiating international agreements or participating in decisions as members of international organizations.[177] Activities undertaken within one state’s jurisdiction should not deprive another state of the ability to realize the rights for persons in its jurisdiction. On the contrary, the CESCR has held that depending on the availability of resources, states should facilitate realization of economic and social rights in other countries, for example through provision of resources, financial and technical assistance, and providing aid when required.[178]\n' +
                'States are also required to “direct the efforts of business entities” towards the fulfilment of the rights set out in the ICESCR and to that end have specific extraterritorial obligations concerning business activities.[179] States should control the activities of corporations under their jurisdiction, so that they do not interfere with, but rather might contribute to the effective enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights outside their national territory.[180] At a minimum, states should encourage business actors whose conduct they are in a position to influence not to undermine the efforts of the states in which they operate to fully realize economic and social rights.[181] The CESCR has emphasized that this duty is particularly relevant to the negotiation and conclusion of trade and investment agreements.[182]\n' +
                'Article 12 of the ICESCR provides that everyone has the right to “the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.”[183]States are required to take steps “individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources” to achieve the full realization of the right to health.[184]\n' +
                'To realize this right, one of the priority obligations of states is to take effective steps for the “prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.”[185] The control of epidemics requires, among other steps, “the implementation or enhancement of immunization programmes and other strategies of infectious disease control.”[186]The CESCR in its authoritative guidance to states on the right to health states that “for the avoidance of any doubt … it is particularly incumbent on States parties and other actors in a position to assist, to provide “international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical” to enable developing countries to fulfil this obligation.[187]\n' +
                'The committee explained, “[g]iven that some diseases are easily transmissible beyond the frontiers of a State, the international community has a collective responsibility to address this problem. The economically developed States parties have a special responsibility and interest to assist the poorer developing States in this regard.”[188]\n' +
                'The right to health facilities, goods, and services includes “the provision of equal and timely access to basic preventive” services, “appropriate treatment of prevalent diseases,” and “the provision of essential drugs.”[189]States have an immediate obligation to “provide immunization against the major infectious diseases occurring in the community.”[190]\n' +
                'States must ensure health services are economically accessible, meaning “affordable for all” and of good quality.[191] In addition, “States have a special obligation to provide those who do not have sufficient means with the necessary health insurance and health-care facilities. …For example, investments should not disproportionately favour expensive curative health services which are often accessible only to a small, privileged fraction of the population, rather than primary and preventive health care benefiting a far larger part of the population.”[192]\n' +
                'Regarding international assistance, the CESCR has stated that, depending on the availability of resources, states should facilitate access to essential health facilities, goods and services in other countries, wherever possible and provide necessary aid when required. When concluding international agreements, states should take steps to ensure these instruments do not adversely impact upon the right to health and states have an obligation to ensure their actions as members of international organizations take due account of the right to health.[193]  \n' +
                'Finally, “when designing a framework on intellectual property rights, consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress stipulated in article 15” of the ICESCR, the CESCR has warned states they should ensure intellectual property (IP) rights do not lead to denial or restriction of everyone’s access to essential medicines necessary for the enjoyment of the right to health.[194] The Committee has pointed out that states have a positive duty “to make available and accessible to all persons, without discrimination, especially to the most vulnerable, all the best available applications of scientific progress necessary to enjoy the highest attainable standard of heath.”[195]\n' +
                'In 2009, a gathering of experts from United Nations bodies including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the CESCR, the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization (WIPO), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), led by UNESCO and including other experts from academia issued the Venice Statement on the Right to Enjoy the Benefits of Scientific Progress and its Applications.[196] The Venice Statement noted, “advances in medicine have helped to cure more diseases and enhance the quality of life. However, these advances are driven primarily by market considerations that often do not correspond to the health needs of the world’s population as a whole, thus affecting the right to health.”[197] It went on to conclude “the intellectual property regime, which is a temporary monopoly with a valuable social function that should be managed in accordance with a common responsibility to prevent the unacceptable prioritization of profit for some over benefit for all.[198]\n' +
                'In the context of a pandemic and in light of the requirement that states do not permit IP protections to impede realization of other economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the rights to health, this obligation should be interpreted to require states to ensure IP and licensing restrictions do not create a barrier to access health care.[199]\n' +
                ' \n' +
                'VI. The Way Forward \n' +
                'The tendency to protect national interests and prioritize profit and financial interests over people’s lives … is not going to disappear. This is why we need to establish a rights-based framework that articulates why and how Covid-19 vaccines, and other medical tools to curb the pandemic, must be seen as global public goods and be made available to all people in equitable ways.\n' +
                '—Fatima Hassan, South African human rights lawyer and intellectual property rights expert, and Els Torreele, access to medicine researcher and former executive director of the MSF Access Campaign, July 2020[200]\n' +
                'The Covid-19 pandemic has shown that the fates of people all over the world are interconnected: protecting one country’s people and its economy from the impacts a deadly infectious disease is impossible unless the people of other countries are also protected. Governments have a critical role to play in funding efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines. But no amount of funding will guarantee equitable access without decisive collective action and global cooperation to challenge the profit-driven and opaque systems that have determined access to lifesaving treatments and vaccines in the past.\n' +
                'Governments should continue to fund Covid-19 vaccines, especially to ensure access for low- and middle-income countries. While doing so, they should take all possible measures, including directing and conditioning funds in ways that are aligned with their human rights obligations to share the benefits of scientific knowledge and its applications widely, and ensure participation, transparency, and accountability in vaccine research, development, and manufacturing.\n' +
                ' \n' +
                'To All Governments\n' +
                '• Fund efforts to develop and manufacture Covid-19 vaccines for the world, particularly for low- and middle-income countries, including through participating in the COVAX Facility and other efforts to pool procurement and equitably allocate vaccines worldwide.\n' +
                '• Commit to sharing knowledge, intellectual property (IP), and data related to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, by endorsing the World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) and implementing the “Solidarity Call to Action to realize equitable global access to COVID-19 health technologies through pooling of knowledge, intellectual property and data.”\n' +
                '• Collectively map out the global capacity to manufacture the needed supply of Covid-19 vaccines, and cooperate to develop a strategy to fund and support the creation of additional manufacturing capacity especially in low- and middle-income countries to ensure rapid and diversified large-scale production.\n' +
                '• Pledge not to sign bilateral deals with vaccine developers to prebook future vaccine doses in ways that undermine equitable global allocation according to public health need.\n' +
                '• Support India and South Africa’s October 2020 proposal at the World Trade Organization to waive some provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and use TRIPS flexibilities at the country-level.\n' +
                '• Urgently introduce legislation to provide expedited compulsory licenses for all Covid-19 health products, including vaccines.\n' +

                'o Attach concrete conditions to all vaccine funding to ensure vaccines are priced transparently and to prioritize affordability and minimize any debts for low- and middle-income countries, and not profits for vaccine-developers. Specifically, ensure agreements to fund Covid-19 vaccines, at a minimum, require that compliance with vaccine price commitments is verified through an independent third-party financial audit and the audit report be published.\n' +
                'o Commit to regular and rigorous independent, third-party auditing around terms and conditions of Covid-19 vaccine funding agreements. Publish detailed reporting on the findings and recommendations of these audits to enable external stakeholders to monitor outcomes. \n' +

            text: 'Why we should consider obesity a disease\n' +
                'Welcome to Health Advisor, where contributors share their knowledge in fields ranging from fitness to psychology, pediatrics to aging. Follow us @Globe_Health.\n' +
                'Is Obesity a disease?\n' +
                'Last year, the American Medical Association officially acknowledged obesity as a "disease." Not everyone agrees. There is no doubt that excess weight can cause a wide range of health problems, including heart disease and cancer – not unlike smoking. But, while we may consider smoking an addiction, we would hardly consider it a disease. So why should obesity qualify?\n' +
                'There are at least three reasons why obesity is different.\n' +
                'The first is related to the complexity of energy balance. While simplistic notions of balancing "calories in and calories out" work well in physics, with obesity we are dealing with physiology (which I like to describe as "biology messing with physics"). Our bodies do a remarkable job of sensing changes in caloric intake or expenditure and show a wide variation in how they respond to such changes.\n' +
                'Overfeeding studies at the Mayo Clinic showed an almost four-fold difference in the amount of weight gained by healthy volunteers who were all fed an extra 1000 calories per day for eight weeks. Similarly, numerous studies have shown that individuals following exactly the same diet or exercise program will vary widely in their weight-loss response.\n' +
                'No amount of binge eating will turn Jack Sprat into a sumo wrestler. Meantime, his wife may well find herself stuck with her own excess weight, no matter how hard she tries to lose it.\n' +
                'Which brings me to the second point: Once established, obesity becomes a chronic problem. This has to do with the fact that our bodies will always defend the highest weight that we have achieved. We refer to this as the "set-point." No matter how you got to 200 pounds, once there, it becomes the weight that your physiology will defend (and it will do so most effectively).\n' +
                'We not only have increasingly better insight into exactly how this set-point readjusts to ever-increasing body weight (through a process of inflammation and micro-scarring in the hypothalamus, the brain centre that regulates energy balance) but we also understand many of the hormonal and metabolic changes that occur as our bodies effectively defend their increasing fat mass.\n' +
                'Rather than viewing fat tissue as a simple storage depot for excess calories, we now look at body fat as a complex organ that interacts closely with other organs to maximize and sustain fat stores (perhaps in preparation for the next famine, even if it never comes).\n' +
                'This complicated physiology, and not simply a lack of motivation or willpower, is the real cause of yo-yo dieting. Indeed, the few people who do succeed in losing weight and keeping it off, will have to continue fighting their obesity every day (whether through caloric restriction or considerable amounts of exercise). For the rest of their lives, they will continue to be at risk of regaining weight should they ever abandon or even slightly reduce their efforts.\n' +
                'Thus, once established, obesity itself creates a vicious cycle that "locks in" a higher body weight. This altered physiology explains why telling someone with obesity to simply eat less and move more to treat their obesity is about as effective as telling someone with depression to simply cheer up.\n' +
                'The third reason that warrants considering obesity a disease is about access to treatments in our health care system. While we spend billions of dollars each year treating the consequences of obesity, we spend almost nothing on preventing and treating obesity itself. Whether we consider access to behavioural, medical or surgical programs for obesity, these are virtually non-existent in our health care system. Compare this to the wide range of specialized services routinely offered to patients with diabetes, heart disease or any other chronic condition (funny enough, – even smoking).\n' +
                'Unfortunately, obesity continues to be viewed by governments, payers, healthcare professionals, media and the public as being largely caused by laziness and over-consumption, a stigmatizing oversimplification of a complex health problem.\n' +
                'In contrast, if governments, healthcare professionals, health benefits payers, media and more individuals viewed obesity as a disease, we can perhaps create a world where health professionals are trained and remunerated for providing treatment services, where people with obesity can seek medical assistance with confidence, and where funders see the provision of obesity prevention and treatment resources and related research as a priority.\n' +

            text: 'Call Obesity What It Is: a Disease\n' +
                'The American Medical Association\'s recognition of obesity as a disease aligns perfectly with the science of obesity prevention and treatment. By acknowledging that obesity is a health problem, not an image or character problem, the AMA joins obesity experts on the path to resolve this health challenge based on the science and evidence of what works.\n' +
                'This recognition is nothing new. Along with other groups, The Obesity Society, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control recognized obesity as a complex chronic disease in the guidelines first issued in 1998. Experts have long acknowledged that obesity is a multifaceted condition with numerous causes, many of which are beyond an individual\'s control. Worse, the disease is a driver of much suffering, poor health and early mortality. And those affected are too often subject to enormous societal stigma and discrimination.\n' +
                'An unclear definition of obesity has certainly led to some confusion across the board. Those affected do not simply look different from others; there is much more happening beneath the appearance of a larger body type. Obesity is a result of the body\'s failure to regulate weight and adiposity (fat), which leads to a disruption of the body\'s processing of food to make energy (or a metabolic disorder). It\'s this metabolic disorder and the resulting chronic diseases, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and many others, that mark obesity.\n' +
                '[See a collection of political cartoons on health care.]\n' +
                'Calling obesity what it is, "a disease," can help direct more resources to needed research, prevention and treatment. It can help to encourage healthcare professionals to recognize obesity treatment as a needed and respected vocation, and, overall, it can help to reduce the stigma and discrimination experienced by the millions affected.\n' +
                'This conversation has been a long time coming and it\'s a vital step toward combatting the epidemic. As we work to define obesity as a chronic, multifaceted disease faced by millions in the U.S., we can identify more effective ways to prevent and treat obesity - the greatest challenge to American health this century.\n' +

                '‘Well, what diets have you tried so far?’ asked the GP, flicking through the patient’s notes. I was an innocent trainee doctor on my general practice placement at the time and watched the interaction carefully, sensing a row was about to ensue. ‘Look, I don’t want to go on a diet, I want you to prescribe me these,’ snapped the patient, bringing out a neatly folded page she had torn out of a magazine. The GP, rolling his eyes at me, took the paper but didn’t read it. I suspected he’d read it before. This was yet another example of what’s becoming a very British epidemic: obesity being self-diagnosed as disease.\n' +
                'The doctor attempted to explain that tablets really aren’t suitable in her case. As well as having some potentially nasty side effects, they’re expensive to prescribe, and don’t offer a long-term solution. This was clearly not what the woman wanted to hear. ‘Fine then, don’t help me, see if I care. I’ll get my sister to get them off her GP — he gives her whatever she wants’; and she stormed out.

            text: "Well, what diets have you tried so far?’ asked the GP, flicking through the patient’s notes. I was an innocent trainee doctor on my general practice placement at the time and watched the interaction carefully, sensing a row was about to ensue. ‘Look, I don’t want to go on a diet, I want you to prescribe me these,’ snapped the patient, bringing out a neatly folded page she had torn out of a magazine. The GP, rolling his eyes at me, took the paper but didn’t read it. I suspected he’d read it before. This was yet another example of what’s becoming a very British epidemic: obesity being self-diagnosed as disease.\n" +
                "The doctor attempted to explain that tablets really aren’t suitable in her case. As well as having some potentially nasty side effects, they’re expensive to prescribe, and don’t offer a long-term solution. This was clearly not what the woman wanted to hear. ‘Fine then, don’t help me, see if I care. I’ll get my sister to get them off her GP — he gives her whatever she wants’; and she stormed out. It struck me as bizarre that while some people using the NHS are dangerously malnourished, other people are desperate to take tablets to ensure that their food passes through their body unabsorbed, while the taxpayer foots the bill.\n" +
                "It happens all the time. The patients who are not interested in changing their diet in any way, demanding to have their cake, eat it and then pop a pill so that the calories never touch their waistline. And as a result, Britain now combines austerity with obesity. The majority of us are now overweight or obese — a third of children are considered too heavy. It costs an extra £5 billion a year, and 300 hospital admissions a day are directly due to obesity. To pick up the newspapers is to witness a country adjusting itself to losing a national battle of the bulge.\n" +
                "Take the East Midlands Ambulance Service. It emerged this week that it has been picking up so many fat patients — weighing in excess of the 28-stone maximum — that it needs a new fleet. It has, hitherto, been struggling along with just one ambulance for fatties (a ‘bariatric’ vehicle), but now thinks all 272 of its ambulances need to be upgraded with double-wide stretchers for patients who (it says) can weigh in at 55 stone. The plan will cost £27 million.\n" +
                "Once the obese patient is in hospital, a whole new set of equipment is required: reinforced operating tables, sturdier trollies, longer needles and even wider MRI scanners. There is a great demand for bariatric surgeons. One of them, Sally Norton, recently wrote in the Royal College of Surgeons’ house journal that without special equipment for the obese, there may be ‘enquiries into the potential use of veterinary or zoological scanners, with resultant loss of dignity for the patient’. There is a cost to all this: in the kit, and in operations like gastric bypass operations, which have increased sevenfold over the last seven years.\n" +
                "Moving obese patients out of their house can be too difficult for the NHS. Recently the fire service had to demolish two walls of a house in south Wales so that a 63-stone teenager could be taken to hospital. This required more than 40 emergency service workers at an estimated cost of £100,000. Over the past five years, fire services have been called to more than 2,700 incidents to assist ‘severely obese’ people, including some who had got stuck in the bath. Rescuing fatties is now a routine operation, with its own entry in the Fire Brigade incident reporting system (filed under ‘bariatric persons’).\n" +
                "So what to do? The government spends money asking us to eat ‘five a day’ fruit and veg, but it seems to have no effect. Nottingham, the fattest region in Britain, recently decided to spend £500,000 on replacing pavements in areas with particularly fat pedestrians, to try and encourage people to walk more. Our landscape is being, quite literally, reshaped in order to accommodate the obese. In the past few years, we have moved from being outraged about the epidemic to just planning around it. Like a middle-aged man deciding to eat what he wants and let himself go, Britain is pulling on a pair of tracksuit bottoms and heading to the fridge.\n" +
                "It need not be this way. For too long, my fellow doctors have pussyfooted around their obese patients, too scared to confront the, er, elephant in the room. They don’t want to cause offence. Unbelievably, draft guidelines announced last year by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence and Health (Nice) suggested that doctors should even avoid the use of the term ‘obese’ for fear that larger patients might be upset. Instead, Nice recommended advising corpulent patients that they should seek a ‘healthier weight’.\n" +
                "But nice euphemisms mean that people don’t confront reality. I’m not going to stop diagnosing cancer just because people don’t like hearing the dreaded word. So why should it be different when informing people that they are obese? Sometimes morbidly so. What Nice is delicately skirting round is what many doctors, nurses and dieticians will confirm: people don’t like being told that they are overweight, even if it’s objectively clearly the case. And by pretending that this is a disease, the doctors are making it even worse.\n" +
                "There’s something comforting about blaming obesity on genes. It enables people to relinquish responsibility for their weight, which can be seen as outside their control. It’s nothing new, either. Years ago, fat people blamed their ‘glands’. When I started medical school, I patiently waited for us to be taught about these magical ‘glands’ that made people fat. I’m still waiting. Even when people have problems with an underactive thyroid, which can slow the metabolism and result in weight gain, this can be treated with thyroid replacement tablets and the metabolism returns to normal. As a rule, however, fat people have one thing in common: they eat more than they need to.\n" +
                "Certainly some people metabolise food at a different rate to others, meaning they are more likely to lay down fat stores than other people. But this is a reason to eat less, not to become fat. You cannot get away from the basic biology of the human body — fat is simply stored excess energy, and weight gain is only possible when the total amount of energy consumed exceeds the total amount of energy expended. Even those who have a genetic predisposition to become fat are not slaves to their DNA.\n" +
                "An in-depth study published last year, which looked at the genes of more than 20,000 people and was conducted at the Medical Research Council’s epidemiology unit in Cambridge, found some people are predisposed to be overweight. But an active lifestyle and reducing food intake can counteract that. Simple. While some will be annoyed by this research, I find it empowering. The idea that our genes control us is profoundly depressing. After all, there is more to being human than a few strands of DNA.\n" +
                "The rate of people considered clinically obese has risen from around 1 to 2 per cent of the population in the 1960s to over 25 per cent now. Why? A simple answer would be lifestyle, but it’s actually a little more complicated. A fascinating survey conducted by the Department of Health compared data collected from 1967 and 2010. It showed that, while people back then were slimmer, they ate fattier foods and had access to far fewer gyms. We eat better now, we work out more. But we live relatively sedentary lives. Only three out of ten households had a car then, compared to seven out of ten now. While 75 per cent of people walked for at least half an hour a day in the 1960s, this is only about 40 per cent now.\n" +
                "What really stands out, more than the lifestyle differences, is the sharp contrast in the attitudes towards obesity between the two different eras. The 1967 survey found that nine out of ten people had attempted to lose weight in the past year, compared with barely half of adults questioned in 2010. Perhaps most tellingly though, 40 years ago only 7 per cent of those people who considered themselves overweight had failed to do anything about it, compared with nearly half now.\n" +
                "It would be easy to blame Britain’s fatness on lifestyle changes, but the worst of it is attitude. People just aren’t bothering to lose weight any more. Perhaps obesity is viewed as more normal. But this is also down to the attitude that we doctors increasingly encounter in our consulting rooms: the reluctance of patients to accept that ailments can be blamed on their behaviour, for which they are reluctant to take responsibility.\n" +
                "Patients blame obesity on the government, cunning food manufacturers, their parents and their genes. They demand fat-loss pills on the NHS and stomach-stapling surgery as a right. In a world where health care is becoming consumerised, patients see themselves as customers. There’s not much demand for hard truths.\n" +
                "America has severe obesity problems, and seems resigned to them. But Britain has a National Health Service, and therefore a far higher capacity to change. It ought to be easy. Doctors should be required to tell patients a blunt truth: if you’re fat, eat less, exercise more, or both. And if you keep guzzling the tasty treats, you will die earlier. It’s not a disease, it’s a mindset — and that means it can be changed. We doctors need to be a little less understanding, a little more judgmental, and realise that our oath — ‘do no harm’ — must come before our desire to save the feelings of our patients. The truth can be the hardest drug to administer. But holding our tongues, prescribing the fat pills and bankrupting the NHS in the process is the worst solution of all.\n" +
